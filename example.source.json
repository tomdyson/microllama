        "content": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects a tiny part of the retina at the back of your eye, called the macula. AMD causes changes to the macula, which leads to problems with your central vision. Your central vision is the vision you use when you\u2019re looking straight at something, for example when you\u2019re reading, looking at photos or watching television. Your central vision can become distorted or blurry, and over time, a blank patch may appear in the centre of your vision. AMD doesn\u2019t affect your peripheral (side) vision, so it doesn\u2019t lead to total loss of sight. This page contains a summary of our information on AMD. To read our full information, download our Understanding AMD guide, which is accredited by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists: There are two main types of AMD \u2013 \u201cwet\u201d AMD and \u201cdry\u201d AMD. Dry AMD Dry AMD is the more common type of AMD. It develops very slowly and causes a gradual change in your central vision. Dry AMD usually takes a long time \u2013 sometimes years, to get to its final stage. At its worst, dry AMD causes a blank patch in the centre of your vision in both of your eyes. Wet AMD About 10 to 15 per cent of people who develop AMD have wet AMD, often having had dry AMD to begin with. Wet AMD can develop very quickly, causing serious changes to your central vision in a short period of time, over days or weeks. You develop wet AMD when the cells of the macula stop working correctly and your body starts growing new blood vessels to fix the problem. As these blood vessels grow in the wrong place, they cause swelling and bleeding underneath the macula \u2013 therefore it\u2019s called \u201cwet\u201d AMD. This new blood vessel growth is medically known as neovascularisation. It causes more damage to your macula and eventually leads to scarring. Treatment is available for wet AMD, which stops the new blood vessels from growing and damaging your macula. This treatment usually needs to be given quickly before the new blood vessels do too much damage to your macula. If the blood vessels are left to grow, the scarring and the sight loss they cause is usually permanent. Everyone can have slightly different symptoms, but usually the first thing you\u2019ll notice is that it\u2019s harder to see detail, such as small print. You may find that your vision has a small, blurred area in the centre. Straight lines may look distorted or wavy, or like there\u2019s a little bump in them. You may also find that you\u2019re more sensitive to bright light. You should have your eyes tested by an optometrist (also known as an optician) if you experience any of these in one or both eyes: You have difficulty reading small print despite wearing reading glasses. Straight lines start to look wavy or distorted. You can check this by looking at door and window frames, or tiles in your home. Your vision isn\u2019t as clear as it used to be. If your optometrist finds any changes to your macula or any cause for concern, they\u2019ll send a letter to your GP or sometimes directly to the hospital. Based on your optometrist\u2019s letter, the hospital will judge how quickly you need to be seen by the ophthalmologist (also known as a hospital eye doctor) and arrange an appointment for you. Your optometrist may refer you to the hospital to see an ophthalmologist if they are concerned about your dry AMD diagnosis. If your optometrist suspects that you have wet AMD then you\u2019ll be referred very quickly to an ophthalmologist at the hospital. Some people diagnosed with dry AMD may find that, with time, new blood vessels grow, and they develop wet AMD. If you have dry AMD and you notice a sudden change in either of your eyes, you should let your optometrist or eye hospital know as soon as possible. This is because dry AMD can develop into wet AMD, and if this happens, sight-saving treatment may be possible. Unfortunately, there is no way to currently treat dry AMD. Although research is going on to try and find out why the cells of the macula stop working, this has yet to lead to a proven treatment. There\u2019s some evidence that high doses of vitamins C and E, the minerals zinc and copper and the micronutrients lutein and zeaxanthin when taken together may help slow down the progression of dry AMD, particularly if AMD has already caused vision changes in one eye. However, there is no evidence that taking high doses of these vitamins can prevent you from developing AMD in the first place. A healthy diet full of fruit and vegetables, as well as regular eye tests, can help to keep your eyes as healthy as possible. Find out more about the research into the role of nutritional supplements in AMD. Treating wet AMD The treatment available on the NHS for wet AMD is a group of medications called anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs. As new blood vessels form in your eye, your body produces a chemical which encourages further new blood vessel growth. Anti-VEGF drugs interfere with this chemical and stop the vessels from growing, minimising further damage to your sight. The medication is injected into the vitreous, which is a gel-like substance inside your eye. This is called an intravitreal injection. Both types of AMD can cause severe problems with your central vision. However, most people with AMD have some vision and there are a lot of things you can do to make the most of your remaining vision. This may mean making things bigger, using brighter lighting, or using colour to make things easier to see. Our leaflet on making the most of your sight has lots of helpful tips: It\u2019s completely natural to be concerned when you\u2019ve been diagnosed with AMD. We\u2019re here to support you every step of the way, and to answer any questions you may have \u2013 just get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service. The Macular Society is a UK charity for anyone affected by macular conditions. NHS Choices has information and advice on AMD."

        "source": "Aniridia",
        "content": "Aniridia is a rare condition where the iris (the coloured part of your eye) has not formed properly, so it may be missing or underdeveloped. The word \u201caniridia\u201d means \u201cno iris\u201d, but the amount of iris tissue missing will vary from person to person. People with aniridia will often have very large pupils (the hole in the middle of each iris) which may also have an irregular shape because so much of their iris tissue is missing. Sometimes, the iris will have a more regular shape and only an eye specialist will be able to tell if aniridia is present. Most people with aniridia have a central part of their retina that is not fully developed, and many have nystagmus, a constant and involuntary movement of the eyes. Aniridia affects both eyes and it is a condition which you\u2019re born with. This page contains a summary of our information on aniridia. To read our full information, download our factsheet: Aniridia is a genetic condition, which means it is caused by a mutation, or fault, in a gene. In most cases, aniridia is caused by a fault in the PAX6 gene, although in a small number of cases another gene might be responsible. All genes come in pairs. You inherit one copy of the gene from each of your parents to make a pair. Your genes give the cells in your body the instructions they need to work well and stay healthy. When a gene is faulty, the genes do not give their instructions correctly to the cells and the cells then don\u2019t develop or work as they should. There are two ways in which aniridia can be inherited from a parent: A parent can pass on the faulty gene when he or she also has aniridia. This is known as familial aniridia. A fault in the gene can arise randomly when neither parent has the condition. This is known as sporadic aniridia. People with aniridia can't control the amount of light entering their eyes because their iris tissue is missing, their pupils remain large, and their eyes do not adjust to differing lighting levels. People with aniridia can therefore experience dazzle, particularly in bright conditions, or difficulty adjusting as light levels change, reducing vision. As well as having an impact on sight, the light sensitivity (photophobia) they experience can cause discomfort and can, for some people, cause headaches. Aniridia nearly always causes other parts of the eye to be underdeveloped, such as the optic nerve and fovea, and can also cause nystagmus. These conditions can also affect vision in addition to the lack of iris. People with aniridia may also develop other eye conditions, such as glaucoma, cataract, and corneal problems. These other effects on the eye can have a larger impact on sight than the large pupil or lack of iris itself. Aniridia and these associated conditions affect everyone differently. So, while some people with aniridia have quite a lot of sight loss, others may have only mild blurred vision. Other eye conditions can be linked with aniridia, some of which can be present from birth and some which may develop later in life. Not everyone with aniridia will experience all these eye conditions. The following eye conditions can be linked to aniridia: Nystagmus is constant and involuntary movement of the eyes. This uncontrolled movement can affect how clearly a person can see and is likely to reduce their vision. Nystagmus is usually present from birth or very soon after birth. People with aniridia often have foveal or optic nerve hypoplasia. \u201cHypoplasia\u201d is a term that refers to underdevelopment of tissue and is a condition someone is born with. The degree of \u201cunderdevelopment\u201d can vary between different people, so how much it affects someone\u2019s sight can vary. People with aniridia can develop cataract at an early age, often in late childhood or adolescence or early adulthood. A cataract is a clouding of the lens, and this will cause sight to become cloudy and misty. Cataract may only affect a small part of the lens but if it starts to affect vision a lot, it may require treatment. Cataracts can be safely left untreated for many years if the vision is not badly affected. Glaucoma is an eye condition where your optic nerve is damaged by the pressure of fluid inside your eye. Glaucoma in people with aniridia can develop in late childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood. Treatment for glaucoma can be given to lower eye pressure and to prevent damage to the optic nerve and to protect sight. Keratopathy simply means an unhealthy cornea. Signs of keratopathy can start anytime from childhood onwards but tends to occur more as people move into adulthood and middle age. Keratopathy usually starts as a ring of clouding around the edge of the cornea, but if it progresses into the centre of the cornea then vision can become hazy or blurry. Keratopathy can make the eye feel dry and uncomfortable, and lubricating eye drops may help with this. Unfortunately, there is currently no treatment to cure aniridia. There are treatments available for some of the eye conditions associated with aniridia, such as cataracts, glaucoma, or keratopathy. Children and adults with aniridia will usually be monitored by an ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) regularly throughout life. This is to ensure that their eye health is monitored for other eye conditions associated with aniridia. Although glasses and contact lenses cannot improve any sight problems that are caused by aniridia, it\u2019s important for children to have any focusing problems corrected to allow their sight to develop as fully as possible. People who are light sensitive find that bright light causes discomfort. The level of discomfort can vary from person to person. Although there is no one solution for light sensitivity, many people with aniridia find that shielding their eyes with sun hats, sunglasses or tinted glasses, or sun blinds in cars can help. More information about coping with light sensitivity can be found on our light sensitivity page. It\u2019s completely natural to be concerned if you or your child has aniridia and normal to find yourself worrying about what it means now and in the future. We\u2019re here to support you every step of the way, and to answer any questions you may have \u2013 just get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service. For children who have sight loss as a result of aniridia, having the right support at an early age can make a big difference. Your local authority should have at least one qualified teacher of children and young people with vision impairment (QTVI) to work with you and your child both at home and at school. A QTVI is a qualified teacher who can provide support with development, play, learning and education. At an early stage, ask your local authority to put you in contact with a QTVI. They will support you and your child as soon as a visual impairment is suspected or diagnosed. If you have difficulty getting help, or need the details of the specialist teacher in your area, contact our Helpline on 0303 123 9999. Depending on how much of a person\u2019s sight is affected by aniridia, they may be eligible to be registered as sight impaired (partially sighted) or severely sight impaired (blind). Registration can act as a passport to expert help and sometimes to financial concessions."

        "source": "Anti-VEGF treatment",
        "content": "Anti-VEGF treatments are a group of medicines which reduce new blood vessel growth (neovascularisation) or oedema (swelling). Anti-VEGF medicines can be used to treat a number of eye conditions that cause new blood vessel growth or swelling under the macular area of your retina, the lining of the back of the eye. The macula is a tiny area of your central retina, which is very important for seeing detail, colour, and objects directly in front of you. When there is new, abnormal blood vessel growth or swelling at the macula, it can cause problems with your central detailed vision and with tasks such as reading, watching television, or recognising faces. Anti-VEGF treatment usually must be started quickly before the new blood vessels or swelling does too much damage to the macula. This page contains a summary of our information on anti-VEGF treatment. To read our full information, download our factsheet: Currently anti-VEGF treatment is used for the following conditions: wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) diabetic macular oedema (DMO) macular oedema caused by retinal vein occlusion myopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV). Anti-VEGF treatment is given as an injection into the white of your eye (the sclera). The drug is injected directly into the vitreous, the jelly that fills your eye. This is called an \u201cintravitreal\u201d injection. The procedure is generally very straightforward and quick and isn\u2019t usually painful. For more information on what it is like to have an anti-VEGF injection, watch our video which features Reg talking about having his anti-VEGF injections. The risk of complications from anti-VEGF injections is very small. Most of the possible complications come from having an injection into your eye, rather than the anti-VEGF drug itself. For most people, the benefit of having the treatment to protect your sight outweighs the very small risk that comes with the injection. Common complications due to anti-VEGF injections can include: Slight ache or pain in the eye lasting a day or two Temporary floaters - clearing in a week Bruising on the white of your eye that appears red or bloodshot, but this should clear in a week or two Eye may feel sore and gritty. Rare complications that may occur from the treatment can include: Infection Increase in eye pressure Retinal detachment Bleeding Inflammation inside the eye Cataract. Although some of these complications are serious, they can be treated, so permanently losing your sight following an anti-VEGF injection is rare. If you are diagnosed with wet AMD you should receive an initial assessment and your first anti-VEGF injection, if required, within two weeks of referral to the hospital or another eye clinic. Usually, you will start by having a course of three injections, once every four weeks for three months. This is known as a \u201cloading dose\u201d. How often you need further injections will depend on the type of anti-VEGF drug you are receiving and how well the treatment is working. It\u2019s very common for people to have more injections after the first three. Usually, you will start with a loading dose of three anti-VEGF injections, once a month for three months. After this, your ophthalmologist will check how well the treatment is working. It\u2019s quite common for people to have more injections after the first three. Your ophthalmologist may want to see you regularly in the eye clinic for the first six months and then perhaps less so for the next 12 months. Anti-VEGF treatment for DMO is given when the amount of fluid or swelling has caused your macula to thicken by a certain amount. Injections are usually given once a month to begin with, and then may continue to be given monthly or may be given every two months. How many injections and how often you might need them will depend on the type of anti-VEGF drug you are receiving and how the DMO responds to treatment. Treatment for myopic CNV usually starts with one anti-VEGF injection. After this you\u2019ll normally be monitored at the eye clinic every month for the first couple of months. You may be given further injections at these visits if your ophthalmologist thinks they are needed. If your condition becomes stable, you may not need further injections, but you\u2019ll still be monitored closely, normally around once every three months for the first year. Anti-VEGF treatments are very successful and give a good chance of preventing further sight loss. In most cases, the aim of treatment is to stabilise vision and prevent it from getting worse. In some cases, treatment can also help to improve vision and reduce distortion. How much your vision will improve will depend on your individual circumstances. It may not help with any other eye conditions that you have. Generally, the better your level of vision is before starting treatment, the better the outcome is likely to be. You should ask your ophthalmologist what improvement they would expect, as they will be able to consider your individual circumstances and eye condition. Although anti-VEGF treatment can mean a lot of injections and visits to the hospital, it is a very successful treatment and has significantly improved visual outcomes for these conditions. It\u2019s completely natural to be concerned if you have an eye condition that requires anti-VEGF treatment. We\u2019re here to support you every step of the way, and to answer any questions you may have \u2013 just get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service. The Macular Society can put you in touch with a \"treatment buddy\" who can support people who are anxious about their injections and offer information and reassurance."
