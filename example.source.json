        "content": "AMD causes changes to the macula, which leads to problems with your central vision. Your central vision is the vision you use when you\u2019re looking straight at something, for example when you\u2019re reading, looking at photos or watching television. Your central vision can become distorted or blurry, and over time, a blank patch may appear in the centre of your vision. AMD doesn\u2019t affect your peripheral (side) vision, so it doesn\u2019t lead to total loss of sight. This page contains a summary of our information on AMD. To read our full information, download our Understanding AMD guide, which is accredited by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists: There are two main types of AMD \u2013 \u201cwet\u201d AMD and \u201cdry\u201d AMD. Dry AMD Dry AMD is the more common type of AMD. It develops very slowly and causes a gradual change in your central vision. Dry AMD usually takes a long time \u2013 sometimes years, to get to its final stage. At its worst, dry AMD causes a blank patch in the centre of your vision in both of your eyes. Wet AMD About 10 to 15 per cent of people who develop AMD have wet AMD, often having had dry AMD to begin with. Wet AMD can develop very quickly, causing serious changes to your central vision in a short period of time, over days or weeks. You develop wet AMD when the cells of the macula stop working correctly and your body starts growing new blood vessels to fix the problem. As these blood vessels grow in the wrong place, they cause swelling and bleeding underneath the macula \u2013 therefore it\u2019s called \u201cwet\u201d AMD. This new blood vessel growth is medically known as neovascularisation. It causes more damage to your macula and eventually leads to scarring. Treatment is available for wet AMD, which stops the new blood vessels from growing and damaging your macula. This treatment usually needs to be given quickly before the new blood vessels do too much damage to your macula. If the blood vessels are left to grow, the scarring and the sight loss they cause is usually permanent. Everyone can have slightly different symptoms, but usually the first thing you\u2019ll notice is that it\u2019s harder to see detail, such as small print. You may find that your vision has a small, blurred area in the centre. Straight lines may look distorted or wavy, or like there\u2019s a little bump in them. You may also find that you\u2019re more sensitive to bright light. You should have your eyes tested by an optometrist (also known as an optician) if you experience any of these in one or both eyes: You have difficulty reading small print despite wearing reading glasses. Straight lines start to look wavy or distorted. You can check this by looking at door and window frames, or tiles in your home. Your vision isn\u2019t as clear as it used to be. If your optometrist finds any changes to your macula or any cause for concern, they\u2019ll send a letter to your GP or sometimes directly to the hospital. Based on your optometrist\u2019s letter, the hospital will judge how quickly you need to be seen by the ophthalmologist (also known as a hospital eye doctor) and arrange an appointment for you. Your optometrist may refer you to the hospital to see an ophthalmologist if they are concerned about your dry AMD diagnosis. If your optometrist suspects that you have wet AMD then you\u2019ll be referred very quickly to an ophthalmologist at the hospital. Some people diagnosed with dry AMD may find that, with time, new blood vessels grow, and they develop wet AMD. If you have dry AMD and you notice a sudden change in either of your eyes, you should let your optometrist or eye hospital know as soon as possible. This is because dry AMD can develop into wet AMD, and if this happens, sight-saving treatment may be possible. Unfortunately, there is no way to currently treat dry AMD. Although research is going on to try and find out why the cells of the macula stop working, this has yet to lead to a proven treatment. There\u2019s some evidence that high doses of vitamins C and E, the minerals zinc and copper and the micronutrients lutein and zeaxanthin when taken together may help slow down the progression of dry AMD, particularly if AMD has already caused vision changes in one eye. However, there is no evidence that taking high doses of these vitamins can prevent you from developing AMD in the first place. A healthy diet full of fruit and vegetables, as well as regular eye tests, can help to keep your eyes as healthy as possible. Find out more about the research into the role of nutritional supplements in AMD. Treating wet AMD The treatment available on the NHS for wet AMD is a group of medications called anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs. As new blood vessels form in your eye, your body produces a chemical which encourages further new blood vessel growth. Anti-VEGF drugs interfere with this chemical and stop the vessels from growing, minimising further damage to your sight. The medication is injected into the vitreous, which is a gel-like substance inside your eye. This is called an intravitreal injection. Both types of AMD can cause severe problems with your central vision. However, most people with AMD have some vision and there are a lot of things you can do to make the most of your remaining vision. This may mean making things bigger, using brighter lighting, or using colour to make things easier to see. Our leaflet on making the most of your sight has lots of helpful tips: It\u2019s completely natural to be concerned when you\u2019ve been diagnosed with AMD. We\u2019re here to support you every step of the way, and to answer any questions you may have \u2013 just get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service.

        "source": "Aniridia",
        "content": "The word \u201caniridia\u201d means \u201cno iris\u201d, but the amount of iris tissue missing will vary from person to person. People with aniridia will often have very large pupils (the hole in the middle of each iris) which may also have an irregular shape because so much of their iris tissue is missing. Sometimes, the iris will have a more regular shape and only an eye specialist will be able to tell if aniridia is present. Most people with aniridia have a central part of their retina that is not fully developed, and many have nystagmus, a constant and involuntary movement of the eyes. Aniridia affects both eyes and it is a condition which you\u2019re born with. This page contains a summary of our information on aniridia. To read our full information, download our factsheet: Aniridia is a genetic condition, which means it is caused by a mutation, or fault, in a gene. In most cases, aniridia is caused by a fault in the PAX6 gene, although in a small number of cases another gene might be responsible. All genes come in pairs. You inherit one copy of the gene from each of your parents to make a pair. Your genes give the cells in your body the instructions they need to work well and stay healthy. When a gene is faulty, the genes do not give their instructions correctly to the cells and the cells then don\u2019t develop or work as they should. There are two ways in which aniridia can be inherited from a parent: A parent can pass on the faulty gene when he or she also has aniridia. This is known as familial aniridia. A fault in the gene can arise randomly when neither parent has the condition. This is known as sporadic aniridia. People with aniridia can't control the amount of light entering their eyes because their iris tissue is missing, their pupils remain large, and their eyes do not adjust to differing lighting levels. People with aniridia can therefore experience dazzle, particularly in bright conditions, or difficulty adjusting as light levels change, reducing vision. As well as having an impact on sight, the light sensitivity (photophobia) they experience can cause discomfort and can, for some people, cause headaches. Aniridia nearly always causes other parts of the eye to be underdeveloped, such as the optic nerve and fovea, and can also cause nystagmus. These conditions can also affect vision in addition to the lack of iris. People with aniridia may also develop other eye conditions, such as glaucoma, cataract, and corneal problems. These other effects on the eye can have a larger impact on sight than the large pupil or lack of iris itself. Aniridia and these associated conditions affect everyone differently. So, while some people with aniridia have quite a lot of sight loss, others may have only mild blurred vision. Other eye conditions can be linked with aniridia, some of which can be present from birth and some which may develop later in life. Not everyone with aniridia will experience all these eye conditions. The following eye conditions can be linked to aniridia: Nystagmus is constant and involuntary movement of the eyes. This uncontrolled movement can affect how clearly a person can see and is likely to reduce their vision. Nystagmus is usually present from birth or very soon after birth. People with aniridia often have foveal or optic nerve hypoplasia. \u201cHypoplasia\u201d is a term that refers to underdevelopment of tissue and is a condition someone is born with. The degree of \u201cunderdevelopment\u201d can vary between different people, so how much it affects someone\u2019s sight can vary. People with aniridia can develop cataract at an early age, often in late childhood or adolescence or early adulthood. A cataract is a clouding of the lens, and this will cause sight to become cloudy and misty. Cataract may only affect a small part of the lens but if it starts to affect vision a lot, it may require treatment. Cataracts can be safely left untreated for many years if the vision is not badly affected. Glaucoma is an eye condition where your optic nerve is damaged by the pressure of fluid inside your eye. Glaucoma in people with aniridia can develop in late childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood. Treatment for glaucoma can be given to lower eye pressure and to prevent damage to the optic nerve and to protect sight. Keratopathy simply means an unhealthy cornea. Signs of keratopathy can start anytime from childhood onwards but tends to occur more as people move into adulthood and middle age. Keratopathy usually starts as a ring of clouding around the edge of the cornea, but if it progresses into the centre of the cornea then vision can become hazy or blurry. Keratopathy can make the eye feel dry and uncomfortable, and lubricating eye drops may help with this. Unfortunately, there is currently no treatment to cure aniridia. There are treatments available for some of the eye conditions associated with aniridia, such as cataracts, glaucoma, or keratopathy. Children and adults with aniridia will usually be monitored by an ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) regularly throughout life. This is to ensure that their eye health is monitored for other eye conditions associated with aniridia. Although glasses and contact lenses cannot improve any sight problems that are caused by aniridia, it\u2019s important for children to have any focusing problems corrected to allow their sight to develop as fully as possible. People who are light sensitive find that bright light causes discomfort. The level of discomfort can vary from person to person. Although there is no one solution for light sensitivity, many people with aniridia find that shielding their eyes with sun hats, sunglasses or tinted glasses, or sun blinds in cars can help. More information about coping with light sensitivity can be found on our light sensitivity page. It\u2019s completely natural to be concerned if you or your child has aniridia and normal to find yourself worrying about what it means now and in the future. We\u2019re here to support you every step of the way, and to answer any questions you may have \u2013 just get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service. For children who have sight loss as a result of aniridia, having the right support at an early age can make a big difference. Your local authority should have at least one qualified teacher of children and young people with vision impairment (QTVI) to work with you and your child both at home and at school. A QTVI is a qualified teacher who can provide support with development, play, learning and education. At an early stage, ask your local authority to put you in contact with a QTVI. They will support you and your child as soon as a visual impairment is suspected or diagnosed. If you have difficulty getting help, or need the details of the specialist teacher in your area, contact our Helpline on 0303 123 9999. Depending on how much of a person\u2019s sight is affected by aniridia, they may be eligible to be registered as sight impaired (partially sighted) or severely sight impaired (blind). Registration can act as a passport to expert help and sometimes to financial concessions."

        "source": "Anti-VEGF treatment",
        "content": "Anti-VEGF medicines can be used to treat a number of eye conditions that cause new blood vessel growth or swelling under the macular area of your retina, the lining of the back of the eye. The macula is a tiny area of your central retina, which is very important for seeing detail, colour, and objects directly in front of you. When there is new, abnormal blood vessel growth or swelling at the macula, it can cause problems with your central detailed vision and with tasks such as reading, watching television, or recognising faces. Anti-VEGF treatment usually must be started quickly before the new blood vessels or swelling does too much damage to the macula. This page contains a summary of our information on anti-VEGF treatment. To read our full information, download our factsheet: Currently anti-VEGF treatment is used for the following conditions: wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) diabetic macular oedema (DMO) macular oedema caused by retinal vein occlusion myopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV). Anti-VEGF treatment is given as an injection into the white of your eye (the sclera). The drug is injected directly into the vitreous, the jelly that fills your eye. This is called an \u201cintravitreal\u201d injection. The procedure is generally very straightforward and quick and isn\u2019t usually painful. For more information on what it is like to have an anti-VEGF injection, watch our video which features Reg talking about having his anti-VEGF injections. The risk of complications from anti-VEGF injections is very small. Most of the possible complications come from having an injection into your eye, rather than the anti-VEGF drug itself. For most people, the benefit of having the treatment to protect your sight outweighs the very small risk that comes with the injection. Common complications due to anti-VEGF injections can include: Slight ache or pain in the eye lasting a day or two Temporary floaters - clearing in a week Bruising on the white of your eye that appears red or bloodshot, but this should clear in a week or two Eye may feel sore and gritty. Rare complications that may occur from the treatment can include: Infection Increase in eye pressure Retinal detachment Bleeding Inflammation inside the eye Cataract. Although some of these complications are serious, they can be treated, so permanently losing your sight following an anti-VEGF injection is rare. If you are diagnosed with wet AMD you should receive an initial assessment and your first anti-VEGF injection, if required, within two weeks of referral to the hospital or another eye clinic. Usually, you will start by having a course of three injections, once every four weeks for three months. This is known as a \u201cloading dose\u201d. How often you need further injections will depend on the type of anti-VEGF drug you are receiving and how well the treatment is working. It\u2019s very common for people to have more injections after the first three. Usually, you will start with a loading dose of three anti-VEGF injections, once a month for three months. After this, your ophthalmologist will check how well the treatment is working. It\u2019s quite common for people to have more injections after the first three. Your ophthalmologist may want to see you regularly in the eye clinic for the first six months and then perhaps less so for the next 12 months. Anti-VEGF treatment for DMO is given when the amount of fluid or swelling has caused your macula to thicken by a certain amount. Injections are usually given once a month to begin with, and then may continue to be given monthly or may be given every two months. How many injections and how often you might need them will depend on the type of anti-VEGF drug you are receiving and how the DMO responds to treatment. Treatment for myopic CNV usually starts with one anti-VEGF injection. After this you\u2019ll normally be monitored at the eye clinic every month for the first couple of months. You may be given further injections at these visits if your ophthalmologist thinks they are needed. If your condition becomes stable, you may not need further injections, but you\u2019ll still be monitored closely, normally around once every three months for the first year. Anti-VEGF treatments are very successful and give a good chance of preventing further sight loss. In most cases, the aim of treatment is to stabilise vision and prevent it from getting worse. In some cases, treatment can also help to improve vision and reduce distortion. How much your vision will improve will depend on your individual circumstances. It may not help with any other eye conditions that you have. Generally, the better your level of vision is before starting treatment, the better the outcome is likely to be. You should ask your ophthalmologist what improvement they would expect, as they will be able to consider your individual circumstances and eye condition. Although anti-VEGF treatment can mean a lot of injections and visits to the hospital, it is a very successful treatment and has significantly improved visual outcomes for these conditions. It\u2019s completely natural to be concerned if you have an eye condition that requires anti-VEGF treatment. We\u2019re here to support you every step of the way, and to answer any questions you may have \u2013 just get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service. The Macular Society can put you in touch with a \"treatment buddy\" who can support people who are anxious about their injections and offer information and reassurance."

        "source": "Antioxidant vitamins for age-related macular degeneration",
        "summary": "There is some evidence that taking a specific combination of antioxidant vitamins and minerals can help slow down the progression (worsening) of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).",
        "content": "According to the research, the potential benefit of taking an antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplement depends on how likely it is for your AMD to progress, and whether it is affecting one or both of your eyes. Although, even then, antioxidant vitamins along with some minerals have only been shown to reduce the risk of AMD worsening by a small amount. If you are diagnosed with AMD with a high risk of progression, then taking a supplement has been shown to slow the progression by about 25 per cent. However, some people may feel that something that could help reduce the risk of sight loss from AMD may be worthwhile. If you have early stage with a low risk of progression, then taking supplements is likely to have no effect. AMD affects a tiny part of the retina, a light sensitive layer at the back of your eye, called the macula. AMD causes changes to the macula, which lead to problems with your central vision, the vision you use when you\u2019re looking straight at something, for example when you\u2019re reading, looking at photos or watching television. The macula is also responsible for your colour vision. Find out more about AMD The different stages of AMD can be classified by the changes an optometrist (optician) or ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) sees at the macula and also how much AMD is affecting someone\u2019s vision. In the early stages of AMD, it is possible to have changes at the macula, which an optometrist or ophthalmologist can see when they examine your eye, but not have any problems with your sight. An optometrist or ophthalmologist may see \u201cdrusen\u201d when they examine your retina. Drusen are small deposits under the retina, which they can see as yellow dots. Drusen can be present as a normal part of ageing and are not always a sign that someone has AMD. Your optometrist or ophthalmologist might say you have early AMD if you have larger drusen in one or both your eyes. Other changes at the macula, as well as drusen, will indicate whether your early AMD has a low, medium, or high risk of progression (worsening). Some people with early AMD are more at risk of progression of the condition. An optometrist or ophthalmologist will be able to see an increased number of larger drusen when examining your macula or other changes that might indicate you are at higher risk of progression. There are two main types of AMD \u2013 \u201cwet\u201d AMD and \u201cdry\u201d AMD. They are called \u201cwet\u201d and \u201cdry\u201d because of what happens inside your eye and what the optometrist or ophthalmologist sees when examining the back of your eye, not because of how your eye feels or whether you have a watery or dry eye. Dry AMD is the more common type of AMD. It develops very slowly and causes a gradual change in your central vision. Dry AMD usually takes a long time \u2013 often years, to get to its final stage. At its final stage, dry AMD causes a blank patch in the centre of your vision in both of your eyes. It doesn\u2019t affect your peripheral (side) vision, so it never leads to total blindness. Early-stage AMD is always dry AMD. Late AMD is when you have wet AMD or dry AMD which has caused extensive scarring to the macula and significant changes to your sight. About 10 to 15 per cent of people who develop AMD have wet AMD, often having had dry AMD to begin with. You develop wet AMD when the cells of the macula stop working correctly and your body starts growing new blood vessels to fix the problem. These blood vessels are very weak and grow in the wrong place, so they cause swelling, leaking and bleeding underneath the macula, this is why the condition is described as \u201cwet\u201d AMD. Wet AMD is classified as late AMD. New blood vessel growth is medically known as \u201cneovascularisation\u201d. Neovascularisation can cause a lot of damage to your macula and can eventually lead to scarring. Both the new blood vessels and the scarring cause damage to your central vision and may lead to a blank patch in the centre of your sight. Wet AMD can develop very quickly, causing serious changes to your central vision in a short period of time, over days or weeks. Treatment is available for wet AMD, which aims to stop new blood vessels from growing and damaging your macula to prevent a worsening of your sight. The nutritional supplements concerned with AMD are mainly \u201cantioxidant\u201d vitamins. It is thought that antioxidants are helpful in AMD because of the \u201cfree radical\u201d theory of cell damage. Free radicals are thought to be partly responsible for the \u201cwear and tear\u201d we call ageing. Antioxidants are thought to help by \u201cmopping up\u201d these free radicals, to delay or prevent them from damaging your cells. Research into vitamins for AMD has looked at whether antioxidants can help to protect the macula from these age-related changes. At present the strongest evidence about which vitamin formula to take comes from AREDS (2001) and AREDS2 (2012), two large-scale clinical trials carried out in the United States. The aim of these studies was to find out whether taking a vitamin formula could help slow down the development of AMD. People on these trials were given high levels of antioxidant vitamins and zinc to see if these could slow down the progression of AMD so that it does not reach the stage where vision is severely affected (\u201clate\u201d AMD). AREDS found that people diagnosed as being at medium or high risk of progression of AMD, who took the \u201cAREDS formula\u201d used on the trial, reduced their progression by 25 per cent. However, the beneficial effect of taking the supplement was not significant in those with a diagnosis of early-stage low risk AMD. The AREDS formula which gave these results, taken as a single tablet every day was: 500 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C 400 international units of vitamin E 15 mg beta-carotene 80 mg zinc as zinc oxide 2 mg copper as cupric oxide (added because high levels of zinc can reduce the amount of copper in the body). Concern for smokers Beta-carotene supplements have been found to increase the risk of lung cancer in smokers and people who have previously smoked. The second AREDS trial, AREDS2, looked at replacing beta-carotene with different antioxidants, lutein, and zeaxanthin. No link has been found between lung cancer and lutein and zeaxanthin for either current or ex-smokers. The results of AREDS 2 showed a similar reduction in risk of progression to late AMD as in the first AREDS formula. Based on the results of AREDS and AREDS2 and concerns about the risk of beta-carotene for smokers, the current recommended daily formula to slow down the progression of AMD in people already diagnosed is: 500 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C 400 international units (equivalent to about 270 mg) of vitamin E 10 mg lutein 2 mg zeaxanthin 25 mg or 80 mg zinc as zinc oxide (as recommended by your doctor) 2 mg copper as cupric oxide. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is the organisation that considers the evidence behind treatments for all general health conditions and provide patients, health professionals and the public with reliable guidance on current best medical practice. NICE has not approved the use of antioxidant vitamins and minerals in the management of AMD. They reviewed the evidence around the use of these supplements, which includes the two large scale studies, AREDS and AREDS 2. They found that the evidence that they benefit people with AMD was not strong enough to recommend that people take these supplements. NICE have recommended that further large-scale studies are needed before they can be confident that the AREDS2 formula is effective at preventing worsening of AMD. However, so far there\u2019s no other research of the same quality to compare these results to, and so at present this is the only information we must go with regarding vitamin and mineral supplements and AMD. This means that at present these supplements cannot be clearly recommended to everyone with AMD. More research is needed to determine if antioxidant and other supplements marketed for AMD are worth taking. Although generally regarded as safe, vitamin supplements may have harmful effects. Therefore, it is always important to get medical advice before starting to take any supplement. If you have AMD, whether it would be worth taking a supplement will depend on the stage your AMD is at and the risk of it worsening. Evidence shows that supplements may help if you are at high or medium risk of developing late AMD. This is if: You have early-stage AMD with a high or medium risk of it worsening in one or both eyes. Taking a supplement may help to prevent your sight from worsening.\nOr: You have wet AMD in one eye and your other eye has early dry AMD. Taking a supplement won\u2019t help the eye with wet AMD but may help prevent wet AMD developing in the other eye. However, there are no guarantees that the recommended formula will definitely prevent a worsening of your vision when you\u2019re at high risk of developing late-stage AMD. The evidence does not suggest that these supplements will help everyone. If you are not sure how advanced your condition is then you should ask your ophthalmologist whether taking a supplement could help. If your optometrist or ophthalmologist has said you have drusen or early AMD with low risk of progression, and your sight is not affected, there is no evidence that taking a supplement will help to slow down the development of AMD. If you have wet AMD in both eyes or have late stage dry AMD in both eyes (your vision is very poor in both eyes), unfortunately there is no evidence that taking a supplement will be helpful. Although nutritional supplements are generally regarded as safe, they may have harmful effects in certain people. If you are thinking about taking a supplement for AMD, it would be important to discuss this with your GP, as taking larger amounts of vitamins and minerals than those found in an everyday diet may not be suitable for you, depending on other medications or supplements you may be taking. If you are a smoker or have ever smoked in the past, it\u2019s important to make sure any supplement you take does not contain beta-carotene. This is because there is evidence that beta-carotene increases the risk of lung cancer in smokers and ex-smokers. The recommended AREDS2 supplement does not contain beta-carotene. Additionally, an optometrist or ophthalmologist can advise if taking a supplement for AMD is the right option for you based on the stage your AMD is at. Unfortunately, we cannot recommend that someone should take a supplement for AMD, or which one they should take. There are several brands of supplements marketed as containing the \u201cAREDS2\u201d formula. If you are considering taking a supplement for AMD, you should choose the ones marked as containing the AREDS2 formula, as these conform to the best evidence currently available. If you are not sure if a brand of supplement contains the AREDS2 formula, your GP or a pharmacist should be able to check this for you. The NHS does not usually fund supplements for AMD; however, this can depend on where you live. Your GP would be able to advise you about what the funding situation is in your area. Sometimes it can be cheaper to buy supplements on the online. It is important if you are considering buying online to buy from a reputable source. The UK Governmental body called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has a register which you can use to check if a website is legally allowed to sell medicines and nutritional supplements to the public. Several studies have looked at the role of antioxidant supplements in the prevention of AMD. At present there is no evidence to suggest that people who don\u2019t have AMD should take lutein and zeaxanthin, antioxidant supplements such as the AREDS2 formula or any other multivitamins marketed for eye health, to prevent them from developing AMD in the future. A healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables is thought to be beneficial in keeping our eyes as heathy as possible. Fruit and vegetables are an important source of vitamins and minerals. The NHS advises we should eat at least five portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day. If you have difficulty digesting food, your GP may recommend a supplement so that you can get the right amount, but most people can get all the vitamins and minerals they need through diet alone. High blood pressure and lack of exercise have been identified as possible risk factors for AMD; therefore, maintaining a healthy weight and living an active lifestyle with regular exercise is recommended. Smoking dramatically increases the risk of developing AMD and is linked to the development of cataract and other eye conditions. Your GP can give you details of your local stop smoking service and you can also get help and advice on quitting from the NHS website Smokefree. Some studies have suggested that exposure to high levels of sunlight (particularly the UV light contained in sunlight) throughout your life may increase your risk of developing AMD, but this has not been proven. However, wearing sunglasses to protect your eyes from the UV light in sunlight is a good idea for everyone throughout their life. It is important if you are diagnosed with early AMD to monitor your vision for changes. Your optometrist can advise you how you can do this. Having regular eye examinations are an important health check for your eyes and will also allow your optometrist to monitor for any changes if you have AMD. Your optometrist will be able to tell you how often you need an eye examination. Being diagnosed with an eye condition can be very upsetting. You may find that you are worried about the future and how you will manage with a change in your vision.

There is no current treatment for Best disease although research is on-going in the area of gene therapy which may lead to a treatment in the future. This page contains a summary of our information on Best disease. To read our full information, download our factsheet: Best disease is an eye condition that affects a tiny part of the retina at the back of your eye, called the macula. Best disease causes problems with your central vision but does not lead to total loss of sight and is not painful. Best disease affects the vision you use when you're looking directly at something, for example when you're reading, looking at photos or watching television. Best disease may make this central vision distorted or blurry and, over time, it may cause a blank patch in the centre of your vision. Best disease will not usually affect your peripheral (side) vision. Best disease is a type of macular dystrophy and is also called \u201cBest vitelliform macular dystrophy\u201d. Macular dystrophies are inherited eye conditions meaning they are caused by a fault in a gene. Best disease can affect both men and women. It usually occurs in both eyes, but it may not affect vision to the same extent in each eye. Sometimes it only affects one eye. Best disease can start to cause changes at the macula between the ages of three to 15 although it does not usually affect vision until later in life. The sight loss caused by Best disease can take many years to develop and some people with Best disease can continue to read into their forties, fifties or well beyond. Best disease is a genetic condition. This means that it is caused by a \"faulty\" gene which may be inherited from a parent or occur as a new fault in the gene. Best disease can be caused by a fault in a gene known as BEST1 (also known as VMD2). Researchers have identified hundreds of different faults within this one gene which can lead to several macular dystrophies, collectively known as bestrophinopathies. These include: Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (Best disease) Adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy Autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy Autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy Retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Best disease is inherited in a dominant pattern. Dominant inheritance means that a disease is inherited from only one of your parents. When the \"faulty\" gene lies in its pair with the normal gene from your other parent, it is the dominant one and \"switches on\" the trait or condition. It is \"dominant\" over the other \"normal\" gene inherited from the other parent. This means that, if a person has one faulty copy and one healthy copy of the gene, they will have Best disease themselves and will have a 50 per cent chance of passing the faulty gene on to each child that they have. If a child doesn\u2019t inherit the faulty Best disease gene, they cannot pass it on to their children. Autosomal dominant inheritance Best disease is inherited in a dominant pattern. Dominant inheritance means that a disease is inherited from only one of your parents. When the \"faulty\" gene lies in its pair with the normal gene from your other parent, it is the dominant one and \"switches on\" the trait or condition. It is \"dominant\" over the other \"normal\" gene inherited from the other parent. This means that, if a person has one faulty copy and one healthy copy of the gene, they will have Best disease themselves and will have a 50 per cent chance of passing the faulty gene on to each child that they have. If a child doesn\u2019t inherit the faulty Best disease gene, they cannot pass it on to their children. Autosomal recessive inheritance More recently researchers have discovered that some faults in the BEST1 gene can be inherited in a recessive pattern. This means that you need to inherit two copies of the faulty gene (one from each of your parents) to be affected by the condition. This is a rarer type of macular dystrophy, known as autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy. Adult onset vitelliform macular dystrophy In most cases of the adult-onset form of vitelliform macular dystrophy, the cause is unknown. However, in some cases, faults can be found in either the BEST1 or in other identified genes including PRPH2, IMPG1 or IMPG2. Many people with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy do not have a fault in any of these genes and the cause remains unknown. The inheritance pattern of adult onset vitelliform macular dystrophy is not yet clear. Not everyone who has the condition has a family history and not everyone who inherits a faulty gene develops symptoms. If someone does develop symptoms, they usually begin between the ages of 30 \u2013 50 with blurred or distorted central vision. The condition progresses very slowly, and many people may retain good vision into later life. If there is Best disease in your family, you may find it helpful to speak with a genetic counsellor, a consultant geneticist or an ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) with a specialist interest in genetics. Genetic testing can help to confirm the gene responsible for Best disease and how it has been inherited. Genetic counselling can help you understand how Best disease has been passed through your family and the chances of passing it on to future children. Genetic counselling is a free NHS service. You can ask your GP or your ophthalmologist to refer you to your local genetic service. Early signs of Best disease usually develop between the ages of three to 15. In these early stages Best disease doesn\u2019t always have much effect on vision, so a child may not notice a sight problem. Sometimes it is picked up at an eye examination where an optometrist can see changes in the macula before vision is affected. Sometimes someone may notice a change in their vision and an eye test then confirms they have changes at the macula which could indicate Best disease. Even though someone may have changes to their macula because of Best disease at an early age they may not develop vision problems until much later in life - often over the age of 40. There are five stages to Best disease which can be seen by the optometrist or ophthalmologist when they look at the macula. None of these stages cause eye pain. Stage 1: At this stage your macula looks healthy and no change can be seen. There may be subtle changes to a layer underneath the macula but there is generally no effect on vision. Stage 2: This stage is called the vitelliform stage. At this stage there is a blister on your macula area which looks like an egg yolk. Although the optometrist or ophthalmologist can see these changes often there is no effect on vision or very slight changes to vision at this time. Usually, this stage occurs between the ages of three and 15 years of age Stage 3: This stage is called the pseudohypopyon stage. With this stage some of the yellow matter which causes the egg yolk-like blister can breakthrough a layer under your retina. This leads to a cyst forming under the retina. Again, there may be little change in level of sight. This stage is usually seen in the teenage years. Stage 4: This stage is called the vitelliruptive stage. In this stage the lesion begins to break up and can cause damage to some of the cells in the layers of your retina. At this point you may start to experience changes in your vision. You may start to notice that straight lines look wavy or have problems with reading small print. Stage 5: This stage is the final stage of Best disease. It is called the atrophic stage. The yellow material which caused the lesions begins to withdraw and disappear. However, it leaves behind scarring and damaged cells on your retina. At this stage your sight is more seriously affected, and you may find reading difficult. These are the classic stages of Best disease however some people develop another stage, called choroidal neovascularisation (CNV). This stage develops during the atrophic stage when the eye starts to try to fix the damage to the macula by creating new blood vessels. Unfortunately, these new blood vessels are very leaky which causes them to bleed and this eventually can lead to formation of scar tissue and further deterioration in sight. However, CNV does not occur in the majority of cases. You can have Best disease for a long time without having any sight difficulties. Your sight is not normally affected until stage 4 or 5 which may not develop until over the age of 40, although it can occur earlier in someone's late twenties or early thirties. It isn't possible to know exactly when or how much your sight will be affected as it can vary from person to person. Unfortunately, there is currently no treatment for Best disease. Although many advances are being made in identifying genes responsible for Best disease this hasn\u2019t yet led to a treatment. A small minority of people with Best disease may develop new blood vessels on or under their macula, medically called choroidal neovascularisation (CNV). The risk of developing CNV is possibly increased by head trauma. Therefore, it makes sense to take extra precaution in situations where you might get a bang on the head, for example, avoiding contact sports or wearing a bicycle helmet when cycling. New blood vessels can be treated with laser and possibly with an anti-VEGF drug injection. Although treating new blood vessels may not lead to a great improvement in sight, it often helps to prevent further damage to the macula and to sight. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor medications (anti-VEGFs) are a category of drugs which stop or reduce the growth of new blood vessels. This can slow their leakage and slow down vision loss. Anti-VEGFs are not yet automatically available on the NHS for people with vitelliform macular dystrophy related CNV, but your ophthalmologist would be best placed to decide what treatment is needed in your case. Gene therapy is currently being researched as a possible treatment for different types of inherited macular dystrophies. Gene therapy aims to replace the faulty gene with a new gene that works properly. Normal genes are injected into the retina using a harmless virus to carry the genetic material. The hope is that that affected retinal cells then begin to work properly and the damage is either stopped or reversed. A lot of this research is in early stages and may take many years before it could possibly become an established treatment, although this kind of research is a positive step forward. There is no specific research as of yet to show that diet can help to slow down the progression of Best disease. However, a good diet full of fresh fruit and vegetables can help with eye health in general. Smoking is known to accelerate other forms of macular disease so it would be sensible to stop smoking as this possibly could help delay progression of Best disease too. Even though there is no current treatment for Best disease it is very important that you receive long-term follow-up care to monitor your condition and its progression. It is also very important to have regular checks with the hospital or optometrist to ensure that any CNV development can be detected as early as possible to allow treatment if needed. If you have been diagnosed with Best disease and you notice a sudden change in vision in either of your eyes you should see your optometrist or let your eye clinic know straight away. This is because some people can develop CNV and if this happens sight-saving treatment may be possible. If you have slight changes in your vision, then you should arrange for an eye examination with your optometrist. They are trained to detect any eye problems and, if necessary, can refer you to an ophthalmologist at the hospital. People with Best disease have a much higher chance of being long-sighted. Long-sightedness means your eyes have difficulty focusing near to. Long-sightedness can be easily corrected for with glasses. Although glasses or contact lenses cannot correct vision problems caused by Best disease, your optometrist might be able to improve your long-sightedness or short-sightedness with glasses to help give you the best vision possible. Your optometrist can check your glasses prescription at your eye examinations to make sure your glasses, if needed, are the right strength for you. It is important to remember that many young people who have Best disease may well have good vision for a long time and may only need help when and if their Best disease progresses to the later stages. Being diagnosed with an eye condition can be very upsetting. You may find that you are worried about the future and how you will manage with a change in your vision. We\u2019re here to support you every step of the way, and to answer any questions you may have \u2013 just get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service. The Macular Society has local groups which meet throughout the country and also offer a telephone counselling service. Sometimes it can help to talk about your feelings or share with people who may have had similar experiences. Best disease can cause problems with your central vision. However, most people with Best disease have some vision that they can use every day and using your vision won't make the disease worse. There are lots of things that you can do to make the most of the vision you have. This may mean making things bigger, using brighter lighting, or using colour to make things easier to see. Ask your ophthalmologist, optician, or GP to refer you to your local low vision service, which can provide you with magnifiers to help with reading, advice on lighting and tips on how to make the most of your peripheral vision for everyday tasks to help make the most of your sight. Local social services should also be able to offer you information on staying safe in your home and getting out and about safely. They should also be able to offer you some practical mobility training to give you more confidence when you are out. Our Sight Loss Advice Service can also give you practical guidance on living with sight loss, and our Online Shop has products that can make everyday tasks easier. Beat the Best \u2013 a USA-based online non-profit awareness and support group for people with Best on Facebook. Although there is no specific UK group for people and families affected by Best disease, the Macular Society is the national charity for anyone affected by central vision loss. Genetic Alliance UK is the national charity working to improve the lives of patients and families affected by all types of genetic conditions."

        "content": "This page contains a summary of our information on cataracts. To read our full information, download our Understanding Cataracts guide, which is accredited by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists: Cataracts normally develop very slowly. At first, the changes they make to your sight may be difficult to notice, but as they get worse, you\u2019ll start to notice symptoms such as: You feel like your glasses are dirty and need cleaning, even when they don\u2019t. Your sight is misty and cloudy. You\u2019re more sensitive to light \u2013 bright sunlight or car headlamps may glare more. Everything looks a little more washed out than it should be. Eventually, almost all people with cataracts will find that their sight has turned misty or cloudy, and things have become difficult to see all the time. Cataracts sometimes develop so slowly that you might not notice any changes in your vision, but when you have your regular eye test, your optometrist (optician) may detect them. Developing cataracts is a normal part of growing older. Most people start to develop cataracts after the age of 65, but some people in their forties and fifties can also develop cataracts. Certain things make it more likely that you will develop cataracts: Diabetes \u2013 people who have diabetes often develop cataracts earlier. Trauma \u2013 having an eye injury can cause the injured eye to develop a cataract. Medications \u2013 some prescription drugs can cause cataracts, for example steroids. Eye surgery \u2013 surgery for a retinal problem will likely lead to cataracts in the affected eye at some point in the future. Eye conditions \u2013 other eye conditions, such as retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma or uveitis, may also cause cataracts. Having high myopia (being very short sighted) may cause cataracts. Despite the different causes, most cataracts are dealt with using the same type of surgery. Some children have cataracts (also known as childhood cataracts) which are dealt with in a different way. Cataracts can be removed by surgery. Cataract surgery removes your cloudy lens and replaces it with an artificial lens. This lens is known as an intra-ocular lens implant \u2013 often shortened to IOL. The artificial lens is made of plastic or silicone and will not need to be changed for the rest of your life. There isn\u2019t any medicine or drops that can remove cataracts \u2013 surgery is the only way to treat them. Unfortunately, there\u2019s nothing you can do to stop cataracts from developing or getting worse, however it\u2019s a good idea to wear sunglasses to protect your eyes from ultraviolet (UV) light. Normally, if you have cataracts in both eyes, they will be removed separately. You\u2019ll usually have one eye operated on first and then once this eye is healed, you\u2019ll have the cataract in your other eye removed a few weeks or months later. An ophthalmologist may consider removing both cataracts at the same time for people who are at low risk of ocular complications during and after surgery, or people who need to have general anaesthesia for cataract surgery but for whom general anaesthesia carries an increased risk of complications or distress. Cataracts can be removed at any stage. You don\u2019t have to wait for them to \u201cripen\u201d before having surgery. Making the decision to have your cataracts removed depends on several things: how badly your sight is affected whether you have any other eye conditions if you only have sight in one eye how you use your sight from day to day. The decision to have your cataracts removed comes down to whether the benefit of having the operation outweighs the small risk attached to the surgery. If you have no other eye conditions or health concerns, then the benefit of having your cataracts removed usually outweighs the risk of surgery. For example, if you\u2019re finding it difficult to read, use a computer or drive, then removing your cataracts may be necessary. The timing of surgery is different for everyone. If you make your living by driving, for example, you may need your cataracts removed earlier than someone who doesn\u2019t drive. If you have another eye condition, it may be possible to have your cataracts removed, but there may be more concerns about complications. Your ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) may want to delay the operation for as long as possible to put off the risk of the surgery, but this needs to be balanced with how much of your sight is being affected by cataracts. If you have sight in only one eye, your ophthalmologist may recommend putting off surgery for as long as possible. Having sight in only one eye doesn\u2019t make the cataract surgery more difficult, but any serious complication which affects your sight would mean the outcome is worse when compared to someone with sight in both eyes. By delaying the operation for as long as possible, this risk is avoided until the operation is necessary. Once you are offered surgery for your cataracts, it\u2019s your decision when to have your cataracts treated. Cataracts only affect the lens and no other part of your eye. If you decide to put off surgery, your sight will become increasingly cloudy, but the results of your surgery, no matter how delayed, will be the same as if you had it done earlier. You don\u2019t have to worry that you\u2019re permanently damaging your vision by delaying surgery. Some people have cataracts removed when their vision isn\u2019t necessarily adversely affected by the presence of cataract, but to help with other eye conditions or monitoring of other eye conditions. We also have an advice page for anyone waiting for Cataract surgery. During cataract surgery, a clear artificial lens is placed inside your lens capsule, the membrane that originally covers your natural lens. Your lens capsule is clear and remains clear following your cataract surgery. Posterior capsule opacification (PCO) is a common complication that can occur sometime after cataract surgery. It is estimated to occur in roughly one in five eyes that have cataract surgery. People develop PCO months to years after having cataract surgery. PCO occurs because cells remaining after cataract surgery grow over the back (posterior) of the capsule causing it to thicken and become slightly opaque (cloudy). This means that light is less able to travel through to the retina at the back of your eye. As a result, your sight can become blurred and cloudy, or you may have problems with bright lights and glare. PCO can be easily treated with a quick, painless, outpatient laser procedure known as YAG (Yttrium Aluminium Garnet) laser surgery, to make vision clear again. The laser treatment removes some of the thickened and cloudy lens capsule to make sight clear again. Once you have had the YAG laser treatment, PCO doesn\u2019t normally cause any long-term problems with your sight. Read more about PCO and the laser surgery used to treat it. If you have any questions about cataracts, cataract surgery or PCO, we're here for you. Just get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service. NHS Choices has information and advice on age-related cataracts and cataract surgery."

        "summary": "Central serous retinopathy (CSR) or central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) affects the central area of your retina known as the macula. CSR can cause your vision to be blurred and distorted due to fluid collecting underneath your macula. The condition usually occurs in one eye.",
        "content": "CSR typically affects people aged between 20 and 50 and is more common in men than in women. However, it can occur in older people too. In most people, CSR gets better on its own and doesn\u2019t cause long-term changes to vision. In some people it may re-occur. Episodes of CSR that last for a long time or keep coming back are more likely to cause permanent changes in your vision. This page contains a summary of our information on CSR. To read our full information, download our factsheet: Macular swelling due to CSR can cause changes to your central vision such as: blurring that is painless distortion blind spots dulled colour vision seeing objects that appear to be smaller than they actually are increased sensitivity to light problems seeing an object against a background of a similar colour fluctuating vision from one day to another. In most cases, no cause can be found to explain why CSR is present. This is known as idiopathic CSR. However, several possible risk factors have been identified that could trigger CSR in some people. The condition seems to occur more frequently in people: with a Type A personality (people who are more highly competitive, are continually stressed and find it hard to relax) who use steroid medication during pregnancy with Cushing syndrome with H.pylori bacterial infection sleep apnoea syndrome. When you\u2019re under stress, your body releases a natural steroid called cortisol into your bloodstream which helps your body to cope. Although cortisol itself is essential for your health, continuously raised levels of cortisol can sometimes cause problems for your body. This can include immune suppression (reducing the body\u2019s ability to fight infection) and increased fragility and permeability (leakiness) of the blood vessels. Although cortisol is currently thought to be linked to CSR, it is not thought to be solely responsible for the condition and cannot explain all cases of CSR. In most cases of CSR, the cause is unknown. The way CSR may progress can be grouped into three categories. Most people will recover within four to six months without any need for treatment. CSR which lasts up to 12 months may require treatment CSR which lasts over 12 months. This is very rare but can lead to further changes such as RPE detachment or bullous retinal detachment. Treatment isn\u2019t usually needed for CSR. Most people will find that their vision will improve within three to six months without the need for treatment. In a small number of people, CSR can be chronic, lasting longer than 12 months. In these cases, sight is more at risk because the retinal layers at the back of your eye can become damaged from prolonged swelling. Therefore, treatment may be recommended for CSR lasting longer than six months. Most people with CSR don\u2019t require treatment. There are various treatment options available, but they are not licensed or NICE approved for treating the condition. (NICE stands for National Institute for Health and Care Excellence). This means that not every hospital has funding for treatment for CSR. If your CSR doesn\u2019t improve, and you are offered treatment, your ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) might suggest thermal laser or photodynamic therapy (PDT). When deciding on treatment, the ophthalmologist would consider: How long you have had CSR, as treatment would only be considered after four to six months of the initial diagnosis. If you experience a recurrence of CSR, treatment may be considered sooner. Thermal laser treatment isn\u2019t given if the fluid is leaking too close to the centre of the macula because it could cause more harm than good. Most people with CSR find that their vision gets better on its own and they aren\u2019t left with long term changes to their sight. However, having chronic CSR can cause changes to your vision in the long term, but there are lots of things you can do which will help you adapt to make the most of the vision you still have. If the eye with CSR was your good eye and you have a sight problem in your other eye, then you may need to make some changes or use low vision aids to make the most of your remaining sight. This may mean making things bigger, using brighter lighting, or using colour to make things easier to see. You may benefit from having a low vision assessment and you can ask your ophthalmologist, optometrist (optician) or GP about how to access this service in your area. During this assessment, a low vision specialist can discuss with you whether using magnifiers and other aids will help you to see things more clearly.

        "source": "Charles Bonnet Syndrome - visual hallucinations",
        "summary": "Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) is a common condition among people who\u2019ve lost their sight. It causes people who have lost a lot of vision to see things that aren\u2019t there \u2013 medically known as having a hallucination.",
        "content": "Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) causes people who have lost a lot of sight to see images that aren\u2019t there. Medically, these are known as hallucinations. CBS hallucinations are caused by sight loss and are not a sign that you have a mental health problem. What people see with CBS fall into two main areas: simple repeated patterns or shapes, such as grids or brickwork patterns complex hallucinations of people, objects and landscapes. CBS hallucinations are silent and do not involve any of the other senses. You cannot hear, smell or touch the images. Although they can be disturbing or frightening, people are usually aware that what they are seeing isn\u2019t real. The hallucinations usually get less frequent with time. It was thought that hallucinations would come to an end within 12 to 18 months. However, a recent study found that it is not unusual if you still have occasional hallucinations even five years after they first started. There may come a time when the hallucinations stop, but they may come back if your sight gets worse. Everyone is different in how they experience CBS and for some people the hallucinations remain with them intermittently throughout life. CBS occurs in people who have lost a lot of their vision from any eye condition. As sight loss is more common in older people, many people who have CBS also tend to be older. However, anyone of any age may develop CBS following sight loss. It\u2019s difficult to know how many people in the UK have CBS because quite often people are unaware that sight loss can cause hallucinations and think that they might be developing a mental health condition. Therefore, they don\u2019t always want to tell doctors that they are experiencing the condition. Recent research suggests that about one in five people who experience sight loss develop CBS. This means that at least 1 million people in the UK are living with CBS. It\u2019s not yet known why some people with sight loss get CBS and some people don\u2019t, but if you have an eye condition which might cause sight loss, it\u2019s helpful to know about CBS so that you are prepared if it does occur. CBS is caused by loss of vision and the way your brain reacts to this loss. Exactly how sight loss leads to hallucinations isn\u2019t really known, but research is slowly revealing more about how the eye and the brain work together. When your sight is good and you are seeing real things around you, the images are detected by the retina (the light sensitive layer at the back of the eye) and signals are sent via the optic nerve to the area of the brain that processes what you are seeing. This area is called the visual cortex. The visual pathway is the term used to describe the route the light takes from being detected by the eyes through to being processed in the brain. Any eye condition that causes damage to any part of the visual pathway can cause sight loss. If your visual pathway works well your eyes stop the brain from creating its own pictures. When you lose your sight, however, your brain isn\u2019t receiving as much information from your eyes as it used to. Your brain can sometimes fill in these gaps by creating new fantasy patterns or pictures. When this happens, you experience these pictures as hallucinations. CBS tends to start in the weeks and months following a big deterioration in your sight but can develop at any time. It\u2019s natural to be worried, confused or frightened when you see things that aren\u2019t really there. Until you know what\u2019s happening, you may be concerned that seeing things is a sign of a mental health problem, or you might think that you have dementia. However, CBS is caused entirely by sight loss and the hallucinations aren\u2019t a sign of any other health problem. If you have lost a lot of sight to any eye condition and you start to see things that aren\u2019t there, then you may have CBS. There isn\u2019t one specific test that your doctor can do to find out if you have CBS. Your doctor will want to rule out other causes of hallucinations, usually by talking with you and in some cases, carrying out tests. If there are no signs of any other conditions that might be causing your hallucinations, and you have recently lost your sight, then it\u2019s most likely that you have developed CBS. There are some medical conditions, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, strokes, serious mental illnesses, and other brain conditions, that can affect the parts of the brain concerned with seeing. These conditions may cause some people to hallucinate. It\u2019s important to remember that having CBS doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re more likely to develop any of these conditions. Sometimes, if you have sight loss and one of these conditions as well, it can make your hallucinations more frequent. Certain things about CBS hallucinations make them different to the hallucinations caused by other conditions. Usually, with CBS you\u2019re aware, or can learn to recognise, that what you\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t real even though it\u2019s very vivid. CBS hallucinations only affect your sight, which means that you don\u2019t hear, smell or feel things that aren\u2019t there. People with CBS don\u2019t develop any delusions, that is, have obvious, complicated thoughts or ideas about why they are seeing things. Even though you may see images which are disturbing or frightening, you would not think that the people or animals you are seeing want to hurt you. If you suddenly find that you\u2019re seeing a pattern, person, animal, building or a landscape that you know is not really there, then don\u2019t be afraid to tell your GP, ophthalmologist (eye doctor) or optometrist (optician), who should be familiar with CBS. You may find it useful to take a copy of this information along with you. You may not want to tell anyone about the hallucinations because you are anxious about what you are seeing, or about what people may think. Even though there is no cure for CBS, letting people know that you have this problem or talking about it may offer you some peace of mind. You can read more about this in the section on \u201cManaging your CBS\u201d later in this publication. Your hallucinations can be of almost anything you can think of, they can range from simple patterns, shapes or colours, to vivid detailed pictures of people, animals, objects or buildings. When you have lost a large amount of your vision it can be difficult to see everyday things, but your CBS hallucinations may be very detailed, and much clearer than your everyday vision. The images appear very suddenly, lasting for just a few minutes or in some cases, several hours. As mentioned before, the kinds of images you may see with CBS generally fall into two types: simple repeated patterns or shapes, or complex hallucinations of people, objects and landscapes. Both types of hallucination can vary. Sometimes they may be in black and white and at other times in colour, or they may move or stay still. You may have one type of hallucination more than another or have both types of hallucination at the same time or one after another. Simple repeating pattern hallucinations Your CBS hallucinations may be of patterns or shapes laid on top of everything you see or growing across any surface you look at. You may see grids or shapes or lines, which can be quite vivid in colour, for example, bright green dots surrounded by vibrant pink squares. You may also see brickwork or simple repeating patterns across your vision. People can also see patterns that look like a network of branches or roots from a tree. Complex hallucinations Your CBS hallucinations may be of more complicated things like faces, people, places, insects and animals. The faces may be distorted or grotesque and move up in front of you. You may hallucinate entire scenes, such as landscapes with waterfalls, mountains or a garden full of flowers. At other times you may see a single person or animal, or groups of people. You may see people dressed in costume, like Edwardian families, Roman soldiers or small children in bonnets. The figures of people in your hallucinations may be life size, larger than life sized or very commonly, tiny. All these things may move or stay still. At times, the hallucinations may fit with your surroundings such as seeing people working in your garden. At other times the hallucinations can appear very odd, such as double-decker buses in your kitchen. Sometimes the images can be totally unreal, like fantasy pictures of dragons or unicorns. CBS hallucinations don\u2019t usually include familiar people or past events that you may have experienced. Not all the images that you see are threatening or unpleasant, but of course, most people are frightened when they first start hallucinating. Over time, the more you see the images, the more comfortable you may become with them. You may begin to recognise the same things appearing in your hallucinations, such as the same tiny people, or the same field of flowers. When you first develop CBS, your visual hallucinations may happen quite often; you may see images every day and for long periods of time. However, everyone has a different experience of CBS, for some people the hallucinations may get less frequent over a few months and they may eventually stop, but for others the condition may continue for years. If your hallucinations do stop, it\u2019s possible that they may come back if you lose more sight. Many people also find that their hallucinations can come back or get worse if they are unwell with an infection, such as a bladder infection (also known as a water or urinary tract infection) or a chest infection. If you find that your hallucinations do come back or get worse, speak to your GP who can check for reasons such as infections. You may also find that your hallucinations get worse when you are anxious, isolated or stressed. You can contact your GP if you are struggling with feelings of anxiety or stress or call our helpline so that we can offer emotional support, advice and information to help with your situation to reduce your stress, access befriending services and emotional support. Currently there is no medical cure for CBS, but this does not mean there is nothing that can be done to help. Sometimes just knowing that the condition is not a mental health problem, nor a symptom of another disease can help a lot. Knowing that CBS usually improves with time (even if it doesn\u2019t go away completely) and having information on CBS as well as sharing your experiences with friends or family can also help. There are also ways to manage CBS that are described below. Everyone with CBS should have a general health check to look for other factors that may be making the hallucinations worse. This includes ruling out memory problems and infections as well as thinking about the medication you are taking. Some medications given for other conditions may have side effects which make CBS worse. It is always worth checking with your GP if your medications may be making your CBS worse. There may be alternatives that you could take instead. It is important you do not stop any prescribed medications without talking to your GP first. Anticholinergics are a group of medications which can sometimes make hallucinations worse, especially in older people. They can be prescribed for lots of different health conditions including motion sickness, bowel and bladder problems. If you are taking more than one type of anticholinergic it can sometimes make your hallucinations worse. Some eye drops can also increase CBS. If you have CBS, you\u2019re likely to have very poor vision, but trying to make the most of the sight you have can help to make the hallucinations less frequent. This may mean making things bigger by using a magnifier, using brighter lighting, or using colour to make things easier to see. A low vision assessment can explore these things with you. Your GP, optometrist (optician) or ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) can refer you to your local low vision service for an assessment. For those people with particularly troubling or distressing CBS there are medications that can be tried. There\u2019s no proven drug you can take to stop CBS hallucinations. Some drugs designed for other conditions, such as epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, dementia and mental health problems have been tried to help manage CBS hallucinations. However, all these drugs are very strong and can have serious side effects. Most people with CBS wouldn\u2019t need them, but they may be useful (if used carefully) for some people. Hallucinations can be frightening, particularly when you\u2019re also dealing with losing your sight. Although the hallucinations may not be of anything frightening, it\u2019s natural to feel anxious and confused just by having the experience of a hallucination. If your hallucinations make you anxious, you may feel like keeping them to yourself. However, even though there\u2019s no cure for CBS, letting people know you have this problem or talking about it may help give you peace of mind. Describing your hallucinations and how they make you feel may help you cope with them. Most people find that talking about their hallucinations with their GP, optometrist (optician), ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor), family, friends or carers can help. Although CBS isn\u2019t connected to mental health problems, professionals who work in the mental health field have a lot of experience in helping people deal with hallucinations. If your hallucinations become upsetting, your GP could refer you to the local mental health team for further help. Talking over your feelings with a counsellor, psychologist or psychiatrist may provide you with ways to reduce the anxiety the hallucinations may cause. For most people there isn\u2019t just one way to deal with their hallucinations, but there are a few things that you can try to do that may help. Change what you are doing Many people find that their hallucinations appear when they are sitting quietly without much occupying their mind. Putting the TV or radio on, or standing up and moving around, or going into a different room can sometimes make the hallucination disappear. Moving your head slowly from side to side, dipping your head at each shoulder may also help. Change the lighting If your hallucinations happen in dim light, then try opening the curtains, turning on a light or the television. Lighting conditions in certain rooms may also mean that you see the hallucinations more often in one room than another. For example, you may find that you rarely get your hallucinations in your garden or kitchen, but that you often see them in your living room. This may be because the kitchen and garden are much brighter and this is helping to control the hallucinations. If your hallucinations happen when there\u2019s a lot of light, then switching off a light may also help. Making sure that the lighting is the right level for your sight condition in all the rooms in your home will help you make the most of your sight and might help with your hallucinations. Look directly at the image or reach out to it Some people also find that looking directly at the image they are seeing or reaching out to touch it or brush it away causes it to fade. Eye movements and blinking Sometimes moving your eyes or blinking rapidly can also help. A study has shown that a specific eye movement exercise may help. When a hallucination starts, look from left to right about once every second for 15 \u2013 30 seconds, without moving your head. As a guide to how far to move your eyes, imagine two points about a metre (three feet) apart on a wall in front of you and look from one point to the other when standing about a metre and a half away (five feet). Your eyes should be held open during the movements. If the hallucination continues, have a rest for a few seconds and try another 15 \u2013 30 seconds of looking left and right. If you\u2019ve tried four or five times and the hallucination is still there, then it\u2019s unlikely to work, but you may want to try again another time or when you have a different type of hallucination. Relaxation or mindfulness Some people find that their CBS hallucinations are worse when they\u2019re tired or stressed. It is important to make sure you have enough sleep at night and have time to relax. Familiarise yourself with the images Sometimes it can help to get to know your hallucinations so that you become familiar with them. You may find that this means the hallucinations become less frightening and easier to cope with. This could mean you have some control over the way you feel about the images you are seeing. Food supplements The addition of real ginger or Omega 3 in your diet has been found to be helpful by some people but it is important that you check with your GP before trying this because this can interfere with some medications. Is it too detailed to be real? When you see something that is frightening or makes you unsure, ask yourself \u201cIs this too detailed to be real?\u201d The fact that the image is detailed and vivid compared with the way you usually see, is a clue that this is an hallucination. As well as these general points, here are a few more tips which may help you deal with certain types of hallucinations. Your hallucinations may change the shape of streets and rooms. For instance, your hallucinations might suddenly make it look like there is a wall or fence in front of you and you may have to check if this is real. This can make you lose confidence when walking around and it may take you longer to get out and about. If you experience hallucinations like this, reach out and check the area around you before you move. Using a cane or walking stick to do this is useful. Moving slowly, feel around for what is real and what is not. Having a good knowledge of your surroundings can also help with these kinds of hallucinations. Hallucinations of people can be frightening, particularly if they\u2019re inside your home. Often the images are of very small people or people in costumes, these can be easier to recognise as hallucinations than if the figure is in ordinary clothes. Having a good idea of when you\u2019re likely to have real people visiting you will help in making you feel secure in your home or your surroundings. Hallucinations of animals are also very common. Often people describe animals on their chairs or in their bed. Sometimes this can be very upsetting, especially if you aren\u2019t keen on a particular type of animal. You can try using touch to make sure that the animals are hallucinations, and sometimes reaching out towards the hallucination may cause them to disappear. \u201cThere\u2019s no cure for Charles Bonnet, but I\u2019ve learned techniques that help me to cope with it \u2013 for example moving my eyes from right to left or blinking swiftly may help to alleviate some hallucinations for a short period. Distractions like listening to audiobooks can also be helpful.\u201d - Bee We offer four specialist groups every week for people with Charles Bonnet Syndrome where you can meet others in a similar situation for peer support. Also, we also have a guest from Esme's Umbrella who attends the group to provide information about the condition. Join a group today Esme's Umbrella is a campaign group to build up a greater awareness of Charles Bonnet syndrome, and NHS Choices has information and advice on Charles Bonnet syndrome."

        "source": "Coats disease",
        "summary": "Coats disease, also known as exudative retinitis, is a very rare eye condition that affects the smaller blood vessels (capillaries) found in the retina.",
        "content": "The retina is the light-sensitive layer that lines the inside of your eye. Coats disease can make these blood vessels weak and grow incorrectly, causing them to leak fluid and blood under the retina. This means that the cells of the retina can\u2019t work properly, and this can cause sight to be affected. Coats disease affects males more than females. It\u2019s usually diagnosed by the time a person is 20, but in most cases, it\u2019s first detected in childhood before the age of 10. Adults can also be affected, and some people, often middle-aged males, can have a milder form of the condition. Coats disease only affects the health of the eye so people with the condition are otherwise generally healthy. The cause of Coats disease isn't fully known (the medical term for an unknown cause is idiopathic) and there are no known risk factors that make it more likely to develop. Coats disease is not an inherited condition meaning that it is not passed on within families. As the condition is rare, it\u2019s extremely unlikely for it to affect more than one child or person in the same family. It has been suggested that for some people, Coats disease may be related to a mutation (fault) in the NDP gene which develops after conception, meaning that the condition happened by chance and was not inherited from their parents. Coats disease affects the smaller blood vessels (capillaries) in the retina. Retinal capillaries are important in supplying the retina with blood which carries nutrients and oxygen to its cells, so that they work correctly. The cells of the retina need to remain healthy for you to be able to see clearly. Coats disease causes retinal capillaries to develop incorrectly. They become wider (dilated) and twisted, which make them more noticeable when the inside of the eye is examined. The medical term for these changes is telangiectasia. As well as becoming dilated, the retinal capillaries also become weak and leaky. This causes some of the fluid from the blood to leak out of the vessels and into the retina. This fluid builds up in the retina and causes it to become swollen. Eventually, exudates (proteins and lipids which have leaked out of the vessels) build up underneath the retina, causing a yellow appearance in the affected area. Where there are areas of exudates and telangiectasia, the retina won\u2019t be able to work properly. This in turn may affect your sight. Coats disease has different stages depending on how it is affecting the retinal capillaries and retina: Stage 1: Telangiectasia (dilated and twisted capillaries) which cause minimal change to the retina and to vision. Stage 2: Telangiectasia and exudates which cause increased changes to the retina and, if uncontrolled, may lead to changes in vision. Stage 3: Large areas of swelling with retinal detachment. Vision is likely to be poor at this stage. Stage 4: Complete retinal detachment and glaucoma (raised eye pressure). These complications can be treated, but sight is still likely to be very poor. Stage 5: The eye has no sight, and there is no treatment that can improve sight. In most cases the eye isn\u2019t painful, but if pain develops, treatment may be needed for this, and to try to preserve the eye. For most people, Coats disease only affects one eye, so many with the condition will have good sight in the other eye. Coats disease is a condition which can get worse, affecting more of the retina over time, but it can stop getting worse on its own, so that not everyone progresses to stage 5. It\u2019s not known why the condition can affect some people more than others, making it very difficult to predict how it may progress over time. Generally, the outcomes for sight are poorer in younger children who are at a more advanced stage of the condition when they are first diagnosed. The retinal changes tend to progress more quickly in younger children, especially those under three years old. Those changes are more difficult to control and are more likely to lead to a greater long-term reduction in their vision. When the condition develops in older children and young adults, it can cause much milder retinal changes which progress more slowly, so that their vision is less affected over time. In the early stages of Coats disease, a person\u2019s peripheral vision is most likely to be affected. If the condition progresses, there will be a greater loss of vision in this eye. If Coats disease affects the macula, then a person\u2019s central, detailed vision will be reduced. Often, an eye examination is the only way to tell if your child has an eye condition. Most children with Coats disease don\u2019t have any symptoms \u2013 the eye doesn\u2019t look unusual, and it isn\u2019t painful or red. Many children have their vision screened when they start school at the age of four or five. However, this does not happen in all areas of the country. If you\u2019re concerned about how well your child can see, or their vision is not screened at school, taking them to an optometrist (optician) will mean their eyes can be fully examined and their sight checked. Sometimes, you may notice that your child\u2019s eye has an odd appearance in photographs, particularly where flash photography is used. Normally, flash photography causes a red-looking pupil but an eye with Coats disease may have a pupil that looks white or pale yellow instead, which some people describe as a glow in the eye. A white pupil is known medically as leukocoria. If you notice that your child has the appearance of leukocoria at any time, it\u2019s important that their eyes are examined urgently by an optometrist or ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor), because as well as Coats disease, there are other serious eye conditions that can give a similar appearance which need to be ruled out. Some children who have Coats disease may develop a squint. This is sometimes described as having a \"turn in the eye\". Having a squint means that their affected eye doesn\u2019t look in the same direction as the other eye. However, the only way to diagnose Coats disease is by examination of the back of the eye. If an optometrist has examined the back of your child\u2019s eye during a routine sight test and believes they may have Coats disease, they will refer them to the eye hospital to be seen by an ophthalmologist. The aim of treatment is to stabilise any changes that are already on the retina and to prevent sight from getting any worse. In the early stages of Coats disease, vision may not be affected, and for some people, Coats disease won't develop any further than stage 1. If the condition is very mild, treatment may not be needed straight away, and the ophthalmologist may decide to monitor the eyes at regular appointments instead. However, where there are a lot of changes to the retina, even when the vision remains good, the ophthalmologist may decide to carry out some treatment to help prevent a deterioration in sight. The treatment offered will depend on what areas of the retina have been affected and by how much. Coats disease can be treated using laser photocoagulation and cryotherapy (freezing treatment). The aim of both these treatments is to help seal up the retinal capillaries to stop them from leaking further. Most children would have these treatments carried out under a general anaesthetic. In more advanced stages of Coats disease, where the retinal capillaries have leaked a lot and the swelling has caused the retina to detach from the back of the eye, the treatment will be aimed at re-attaching the retina. The type of treatment may vary depending upon how large the detachment is and how long the retina has been detached for but may include surgery to re-attach the retina. Occasionally, in certain circumstances, injections may be given into the eye. These treatments may include either anti-VEGF medication or steroids. As well as retinal detachment, there may be other complications for someone with Coats disease which also require treatment, such as uveitis, the development of a cataract, or glaucoma. Cataract and glaucoma are also side effects that can develop from having steroid treatment. There are, unfortunately, some people for whom treatment is not successful because their eye doesn\u2019t respond to any of the treatments they receive. In these cases, it\u2019s possible that they may lose all the sight in their eye. Usually, their eye won\u2019t become uncomfortable. However, very rarely, glaucoma develops which cannot be controlled, and this can cause the eye to become very painful. If the eye pressure remains too high and causes continual and intense pain, the ophthalmologist may suggest that removing the eye and replacing it with an artificial one is the best next step to take, but this is always a last resort and is not suggested very often. Most people with Coats disease do not experience this type of complication and so they will not need to have their eye removed. Coats disease usually only affects one eye while the other eye may have good sight. When someone has good sight in one eye, and poor or no sight in the other, they have what is known as monocular vision. Children tend to adapt very well to using their better eye. This doesn\u2019t mean that they will be overusing or damaging their better eye as this adaptation is a natural process. It\u2019s unusual for children with good vision in one eye to need additional support in their education. People with monocular vision are not considered partially sighted. Having monocular vision can affect depth perception and hand-eye coordination. With some tasks, your child may appear clumsy and uncoordinated at first, for example when they throw and catch a ball. However, this generally improves as your child gets older and adapts to being monocular. Even with good vision in their better eye, someone with monocular vision doesn't have as much peripheral vision as someone with two eyes. With time they will adapt to this without realising by turning their head more to see things around them. Other people can help by sitting or approaching someone with monocular vision on the same side as their good eye, to make it easier for them to be seen. It\u2019s important for people who have good sight in only one eye to have regular eye tests with an optometrist so that the health of their good eye can be monitored. Your optometrist should let you know how often you need to have your eyes examined. For people who have sight in only one eye, it may be a good idea to consider the use of protective eyewear or sports goggles for certain sports or activities to help prevent injury to the good eye. You can speak to a dispensing optician at your local optician's practice for more advice about this. Dispensing opticians are qualified in the dispensing and fitting of spectacles and can give professional advice about suitable frames and lenses. People with monocular vision are still able to drive a private vehicle (Group 1) as long as the vision in their better eye is unaffected by any other eye conditions, and it meets the visual requirements for driving. However, monocular vision would mean you couldn't hold a heavy good vehicle (HGV) or public service vehicle (PSV) licence (Group 2). Some professions, such as being a pilot, police officer or certain roles within the Armed Forces require a specific level of vision to be reached in both eyes. Keeping this in mind can help with planning a career choice for the future. It\u2019s completely natural to be upset when you or your child has been diagnosed with Coats\u2019 disease and it\u2019s normal to find yourself worrying about the future and how you or your child will manage with a change in vision.

        "source": "Coloboma",
        "summary": "Coloboma means that part of one or more structures inside an unborn baby\u2019s eye does not fully develop during pregnancy.",
        "content": "This underdeveloped tissue is normally in the lower nasal (down and towards the nose) part of the eye and it can be small or large. A coloboma occurs in about 1 in 5,000 births and by develops at around five to seven weeks of pregnancy. Coloboma can affect one eye (unilateral) or both eyes (bilateral) and it can affect different parts of the eye. As coloboma forms during the initial development of the eye, it is present from birth and into adulthood. This page contains a summary of our information on coloboma. To read our full information, download our factsheet: During the second month of pregnancy, the buds that become the eyes develop and fold round in a cup-like shape from which the structures of the eye will form. As the developing eye folds round, it should join together, from the back to the front of the bottom of the cup. If this seam doesn\u2019t join completely, there will be tissue missing at the bottom of the structures being formed, leading to coloboma. Most cases of coloboma appear without any previous family history, although in some families coloboma can be inherited, or could be caused by environmental factors such as certain drugs or infections during pregnancy. The effect that coloboma has on vision depends on which structures of the eye are involved and how much tissue is missing. Coloboma can affect your iris, the tissue that gives you your eye colour. Your pupil may look oval if the coloboma is partial, but if more of your lower iris is missing, your pupil will look more keyhole shaped. Both children and adults with only iris coloboma will probably have fairly good vision. However, iris coloboma is likely to cause light sensitivity (also called photophobia) in bright conditions. Light sensitivity and glare can cause discomfort and affect the quality of vision. If the lens of the eye is affected by coloboma, vision is likely to be blurred because of the change in lens shape caused by a notch or dent. There may also be some degree of cataract in the affected eye, which means the lens is cloudy instead of being clear. This cloudiness can cause symptoms such as blurred or misty vision, colours appearing dull and glare in your vision. At the back of your eye, the retina (the light-sensitive layer) and the choroid (the layer of tissue and blood vessels behind the retina) can be affected by coloboma. This is known as a chorioretinal coloboma. An optic disc coloboma is where the optic nerve (which carries information from the eye to the brain) is affected by coloboma where it leaves the back of your eye, an area known as the optic disc. Some people with chorioretinal coloboma may not be aware of any visual symptoms. However, the more retinal tissue that is missing, the more their sight is likely to be affected, usually in the upper region of their field of vision. If the chorioretinal coloboma is large or there is optic disc coloboma, they are likely to have poor central vision. This will make activities such as reading, writing and watching television more difficult. If both eyes are affected by optic disc coloboma, they may also have nystagmus, meaning that their eyes move constantly and uncontrollably. Sometimes, coloboma can increase the risk of other eye conditions, including: Glaucoma Retinal detachment Choroidal neovascularisation Cataract. Many children and adults with iris coloboma will require no treatment. However, some have a special contact lens fitted that covers the keyhole-shaped pupil and makes it look round. This improves the cosmetic appearance of the eye as well as reducing light sensitivity. For some people, surgery is an option, where the gap in the iris is sewn together to correct the pupil shape and reduce light sensitivity. For other types of coloboma inside the eye, there is no treatment at present. However, other eye health problems that are associated with coloboma, such as glaucoma, retinal detachment, choroidal neovascularisation and cataract can be treated. It\u2019s important for people with coloboma to have regular eye examinations with their optometrist (optician), who will be able to check for any changes to their eye health. An optometrist will give advice on how often an eye examination is necessary. A person with coloboma who experiences any new symptoms or concerns should have their eyes examined straight away. Although glasses and contact lenses are unable to improve any sight problems that are caused by coloboma, it\u2019s important for children to have any focusing problems corrected to allow their sight to develop as fully as possible. Tinted glasses, sun hats or sun blinds in cars can help to relieve light sensitivity. Your optometrist will be able to offer further advice about this. It\u2019s completely natural to be concerned if you or your child has coloboma and normal to find yourself worrying about what it means now and in the future. We\u2019re here to support you every step of the way, and to answer any questions you may have \u2013 just get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service. You or your child may have normal vision or there may be some degree of sight loss. For a child, it\u2019s difficult to predict to what extent their vision will be affected by coloboma in the long term. It's therefore important for them to attend their hospital eye clinic appointments and eye examinations to ensure they have the greatest chance of developing the best vision they can. It\u2019s also important for adults to have regular eye examinations too. For children who have sight loss as a result of their coloboma, having the right support at an early age can make a big difference. Your local authority should have at least one qualified teacher of visually impaired children (QTVI) to work with you and your child both at home and at school. QTVIs are qualified teachers who can provide support with development, play, learning and education. At an early stage, ask your local authority to put you in contact with a QTVI. If you have difficulty getting help, or need the details of the specialist teacher in your area, contact our Helpline. MACS (Microphthalmia, Anophthalmia & Coloboma Support) can provide support and information to parents and carers of children with microphthalmia, anophthalmia, coloboma and related conditions.

        "source": "Congenital cataracts",
        "summary": "A cataract can make your vision blurry or misty, a bit like trying to look through frosted glass. Some babies are born with cataracts or develop cataracts at a very early age. This is known as congenital or infantile cataracts.",
        "content": "A cataract is a clouding of the lens inside your eye. Your lens sits just behind your iris, the coloured part of your eye. The lens of your eye is usually clear and helps to focus the light entering your eye, but a lens that is opaque (misty or cloudy) is said to have a cataract. Cataracts can cause your sight to be blurry or hazy. It is not a layer of skin that grows over your eye or eyes; it is simply the lens of the eye(s) that has become cloudy. Some babies are born with cataracts and some develop them in the first six months of their lives. When a baby is born with a cataract, it is called a \u201ccongenital cataract\u201d. If a cataract develops in the first six months of life, it is known as an \u201cinfantile cataract\u201d. Children can have cataract in one (unilateral) or both (bilateral) eyes. Most children with cataract in only one eye usually have good vision in the other. When light enters your eye, it is focused first by the cornea, which is the clear window at the front of the eye, and then more accurately by the lens so that it is correctly focused on the retina. The focusing that the cornea and lens do help to make your vision clear and sharp. Your retina is the light sensitive layer that lines the back of your eye. It converts the light into electrical signals that travel along the optic nerve to our brain. The brain interprets these signals so we can \"see\" the world around us. When you\u2019re born, your eyes and brain must learn to work together. As you grow, you use your eyes to collect visual information which is sent to the brain to process, and this builds up a connection between them. This connection between the eyes and the brain is known as the visual pathway. The visual pathway develops throughout your childhood and up to the age of about seven or eight years old. During this time, it\u2019s important that your eyes send clear and similar images to your brain. The eyes and brain use your visual experiences to improve how they work together (their co-ordination) and allow your visual pathway to develop as fully as possible. The most crucial time is the first two to four months of life: if the eyes don\u2019t send the brain a clear image during this time, the brain may never learn to see clearly. After the age of about eight years old, the visual pathways and the \u201cseeing\u201d parts of the brain are fully formed and are difficult to change. If a child is born with an eye condition which affects vision, such as cataract, then their visual pathway may not develop normally. This is because a cataract lowers the amount of visual stimulation the eye and brain receive. Therefore, it\u2019s critical to treat childhood sight issues which happen in the first few months of life. If one of your child's eyes is sending poorly focused, unclear images to their brain because they have a cataract in this eye, their brain will learn to ignore these images in favour of those provided by the other better seeing, or \u201cstronger\u201d eye. This prevents the visual pathway from developing properly in the eye which has the cataract. This is known as amblyopia or \u201clazy eye\u201d. Amblyopia may result in permanently reduced vision as the visual pathway has not developed, particularly when the brain doesn\u2019t get a chance to see clear images in the first few months of life. With unilateral congenital cataract, the brain tends to rely on the eye without a cataract and learns to switch off from the eye with the cataract and reduced vision. In these cases, it can be difficult to encourage the visual pathway to develop in the eye with the cataract. Bilateral cataracts can cause amblyopia to develop in both eyes. If a child has bilateral cataracts so that both eyes are sending a cloudy image to the brain in the first months of life, then the brain will \u201cignore\u201d the images from both eyes. The visual pathway may still develop, but it would be limited and therefore result in some vision being reduced permanently. There are many types of congenital cataract. Some affect vision and others never do. A cataract located towards the centre of the lens is more likely to affect vision and visual pathway development, than one which is around the edge of the lens, though this will depend on its size and how dense, or cloudy, the cataract is. Very dense cataracts can cause blindness in babies if left untreated, or if treated too late. An ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) will check your child's eyes and vision and be able to tell you how much the cataract is affecting your child's vision. Congenital cataracts can continue to develop, although this normally takes months to years. The ophthalmologist would assess how much the cataract is affecting your child's vision and then discuss treatment with you if they feel it is needed. Around 3-4 per 10,000 children born in the UK have a cataract which affects vision. About a third of cataracts do not have any cause and aren\u2019t linked with any other disease or condition. Unilateral cataract usually has no known cause. In some cases, it can be linked with other conditions in the eye, such as having an abnormally small eye, or other eye structures not developing as they should when the baby was growing in the womb. Bilateral cataracts often run in families, which means a baby might inherit them. They can also be linked with other conditions affecting the entire body or infections, such as measles or rubella, when the baby was growing in the womb. Medical conditions that affect the baby\u2019s metabolism, that is how their body turns food into energy, can also cause congenital cataracts. If a cataract is passed on to a baby from a parent, it is usually dominantly inherited. Dominant inheritance means that you inherit the condition from only one of your parents. Genes usually come in pairs. You inherit one gene from each of your parents to make each pair. In dominant inheritance, the \u201cfaulty\u201d gene that is inherited from one parent is the dominant one and over-rides the \u201cnormal\u201d gene from the other parent. One parent may know that they have cataracts themselves but sometimes they may only have a tiny cataract which doesn\u2019t affect their vision and which they\u2019re unaware of. This is why it can be helpful for the ophthalmologist to examine the eyes of the parents and siblings of a child with cataract even if they\u2019re unaware of any issues with their eyes. Most children who are born with or develop infantile cataracts do not have other medical problems, however some do. If an ophthalmologist is concerned that a baby may have other health conditions they will arrange for an examination from a paediatrician (a doctor specialising in children\u2019s conditions). If the paediatrician or paediatric nurse suspects that your child has a congenital cataract at birth, they will arrange a referral to an ophthalmologist for a full examination of their eyes. An ophthalmologist would carry out this examination at hospital. All babies in the UK are screened for eye problems including congenital cataracts within the first 72 hours after birth as part of the National Screening procedure. Babies are normally checked again by a health visitor or community paediatrician around six to eight weeks of age. If you are concerned about your baby's vision it would be important to discuss it with your health visitor. Your baby\u2019s \u201cred book\u201d (Personal Child Health Record) has advice on how their vision will develop. If your health visitor notices any signs of a possible eye issue or cataract, they would refer your baby to a hospital ophthalmologist for a full examination. If cataracts develop later in childhood, there may be noticeable outward signs if they affect vision. For example, sometimes a child may appear to have difficulty focusing on certain objects, may develop a wobbly movement in the eyes (nystagmus), may hold their head at a certain angle or they may develop a squint (a turn in one eye). If you\u2019re concerned at any stage that your baby or child isn\u2019t seeing normally, you should discuss this with your GP or an optometrist (optician). Your GP or optometrist would assess your child's eyes and refer them to see an ophthalmologist. Usually, the ophthalmologist would examine your child\u2019s eye with a microscope before and after putting some dilation drops into your child's eyes to make their pupil larger. Dilation allows more light into the eye so they can see the cataract more clearly and examine the health of the eye. An ophthalmologist would also use an instrument called an ophthalmoscope to examine the back of your child's eyes, to look for any other eye related issues. The ophthalmoscope and the lenses the ophthalmologist use to view your child\u2019s eye will not touch it. Sometimes a child may be given a general anaesthetic to allow the ophthalmologist to carry out an eye examination. This allows them to look thoroughly at your child\u2019s eye while they are still and without causing any distress. It is unlikely that a cataract would change the appearance of a baby\u2019s eye so that their parent would be able to notice it themselves. A very dense cataract can cause a baby or child\u2019s pupil to look white as the cloudy cataract can be seen through it. However, there are other causes of a \u201cwhite pupil\u201d which would need to be checked as an emergency as they can be serious. Some cataracts do not cause visual problems and treatment is not needed. If the cataract is affecting your child's vision, surgery will usually be considered to remove the affected lens from the eye. Once a cataract is removed it cannot grow back. If your baby\u2019s cataract or cataracts are likely to have a significant effect on their vision, surgery is considered early on and under the age of three months as visual development in the first few months of life is vital. The ophthalmologist will discuss the options with you and what treatment might give the best results. They will discuss both the risks and benefits of surgery with you before any decision is made. Bilateral cataracts which only affect a small area of your child\u2019s lenses may just need monitoring to track their progress. Dense cataracts that are likely to interfere with your baby\u2019s vision are usually removed very early, during the first few months of life. If one eye has a denser cataract and the other has a smaller or less dense cataract, then the eye with the denser cataract would usually be treated first. If surgery is required in both eyes, then it may be done on the same day or scheduled very soon after the first one. Unilateral cataract that is large and located in the middle of the lens will need to be operated on early for your child to have the best visual outcome. However, unilateral cataract that is small, or doesn't affect the centre of the lens, may not require surgery immediately; instead patching the good eye or using dilating drops in the good eye so that your child is forced to use the affected eye may be prescribed. It\u2019s still possible that a small cataract affecting only one eye will cause amblyopia, so the specialist may still wish to treat your baby\u2019s cataract despite it being small. If your child has unilateral cataract, or bilateral cataracts with a cloudier lens on one side, your child's ophthalmologist will also consider patching your child's stronger eye to help their brain switch onto the weaker eye. This is just as important as the cataract surgery itself. Children with unilateral or congenital cataract affecting one eye more than the other, are very unlikely to have good vision after surgery unless some patching is used. Patching is discussed in more detail under \u2018amblyopia\u2019 further on in this information. Your child will be given a general anaesthetic so that they won't be able to feel anything during the operation. The surgeon will make several small openings in the side of the cornea at the front of the eye, and then make a small hole in the natural capsular bag which encases the lens inside the eye. The cloudy lens is removed via these holes using suction. In children aged under five years, a hole is also made in the back of the capsule, through which some of the jelly (vitreous gel) that normally sits in the middle of the eye is removed. The vitreous gives internal support to the eyeball and is usually held in place by the lens. Removal of some of the gel is necessary to stop it coming forwards in a young eye and causing problems after cataract removal. All the holes made in the cornea are stitched closed using sutures that will dissolve in time. Usually, you and your baby will stay at the hospital overnight so the clinical team can make sure your baby has recovered well from the anaesthetic and can show you how to care for your baby\u2019s eye. Once your child's natural lens with cataract has been removed, it may be replaced by an artificial clear plastic lens implant placed inside the eye, called an intraocular lens or IOL. If a lens implant is used during surgery, it is hoped that it will last for life and not need replacing. If your child is very young (aged under two years), then the ophthalmologist may recommend using a contact lens on the front of the eye rather than an implant inside the eye. This is because IOLs in younger eyes often lead to children needing more surgery to remove membranes that grow across the artificial lenses (called visual axis opacity). It is also difficult to correctly estimate the power of the IOL needed for a young child\u2019s eye. When your baby is born, their natural eye's lens is very round and more powerful than in adulthood. The power of your baby's lens and the length of their eye from front to back (axial length) changes rapidly over the first few years of their life. This means that the power of an IOL used at a very young age may not be right for them as they get older, and this can cause short sightedness (when distance vision is not focused properly). Children who have IOLs at the time of cataract surgery can end up needing very strong glasses anyway. However, leaving a child without a lens inside their eye (called aphakic), can cause severe long sightedness (when close vision is not focused properly), so that contact lens and/or glasses are needed to correct vision. As contact lenses are not implanted into the eye, so they are much easier to change or remove if necessary. IOLs can be implanted later, in a separate surgical procedure, when a child is a bit older and their eye is more developed; this will reduce the chances of inflammatory membranes from growing across the IOL and deciding on the best power for the IOL will be more accurate. An IOL is often used during cataract surgery for older children. The decision to use an IOL is very individual and although a good option for one child, it may not be the best or safest option for another. The ophthalmologist would discuss with you the possible risks and benefits of using an IOL for your child. They would consider both your child's level of vision and their age. Most children will have a lens implanted at some point and will require glasses or contact lenses as well to provide the best possible vision for them. Following the operation, your child's eye will be a bit painful for the first day. The hospital will give you eye drops to put in your child's eye every two to four hours which will help to prevent inflammation or infection. After cataract surgery you would usually put eye drops in your child's eye for a month or two to help the healing process. The hospital may also give medicine or tablets for the first night after surgery to help with any pain. The ophthalmologist will monitor recovery following surgery and check on progress. They will also advise you on how to use any medication or eye drops. The nurses will show you how to put drops into your child's eye before they are discharged from the hospital. Putting drops and/or ointments into a baby\u2019s eye can be tricky. There are some very helpful videos that you can watch online showing different techniques that can be used to instil drops in young babies and children; links to useful videos and podcasts can be found at the end of this information. The nurses will also go over any post-operative care techniques, such as bathing your child, wearing a plastic eye shield, or keeping the eye clean without wiping inside the eye or washing it out. It\u2019s important to protect your child's eye and keep it clean following surgery, including being careful not to get dirty water or shampoo in the eye. This is to give their eye the best recovery and to minimise the risk of infection. It also helps your child to feel as comfortable as possible. The hospital may provide an eye shield to place over your child\u2019s eye especially for use at night. This helps to protect the eye as a shield can usually stop your child from rubbing their eye whilst it is healing from surgery. The hospital staff would tell you when and for how long to use the shield. They would also normally give you a sheet of instructions on how to look after your child's eye whilst they are recovering from cataract surgery. After cataract surgery children usually need glasses or contact lenses. This is because the artificial lens implant or contact lens used to replace your child's natural lens has a fixed focus. This means it can't change shape to focus clearly both near and in the distance as our natural eye lens can. Glasses will help make sure your child can see as clearly as possible at all distances, and make sure that a clear image is being presented to their developing brain. Glasses or contact lenses will help make sure your child can see as clearly as possible at all distances and make sure that a clear image is being presented to their developing brain. This is extremely important to your baby\u2019s visual development and therefore glasses and contact lenses should be worn as prescribed. Your child might need a pair of glasses or contact lenses which correct either their near or distance vision. Or they may need bifocal glasses where the top section of the lens corrects distance vision and the bottom part of the lens corrects near vision. If your child does not have an IOL implanted during cataract surgery, then they would also be prescribed glasses and/or contact lenses. Glasses for children without an IOL would require a strong prescription making them thick and heavy. Sometimes in very young babies, it can be difficult to find glasses that will stay on a baby\u2019s face. For these reasons, contact lenses are often a more practical solution. The hospital specialists can usually provide the right glasses or contact lenses for your child. They will also show you how to put the lenses in and take them out of your child's eye or eyes so you can feel confident doing this at home. If your child is under the age of one, the hospital may wish to monitor their eyes every two to three months to check how well they are focusing. As a child grows, their eyes will grow. It is very common to have frequent changes in glasses and contact lens prescriptions in the first few years. After surgery some children may develop an eye complication such as: Glaucoma A condition that causes damage to the optic nerve eye structure resulting from an increase in eye pressure. This is always a possible risk in children who have had congenital cataract surgery, meaning they will require regular monitoring in the long term. Glaucoma can usually be managed with eye drops but, when it develops after congenital cataract surgery, it often needs to be treated with surgery. Visual axis opacity (VAO) This is a very common complication that can occur following cataract surgery. It occurs because lens cells remaining after cataract surgery collect to form a membrane which grows across the holes made in the capsular bag causing it to thicken and become slightly opaque (cloudy). This means that light is less able to travel through to the retina at the back of the eye. Further surgery may be required to correct this. You can find more information about VAO, which in adults is called posterior capsular opacity (PCO), on our website or by calling our Helpline. Eye infection Antibiotic drops normally safeguard against infection. If a serious and rare eye infection called endophthalmitis develops then it can threaten sight in that eye. However, this kind of serious infection is rare and can be treated. Retinal detachment This is where the retina detaches from the back of the eye. Thanks to modern surgery techniques which allow removal of the vitreous gel without pulling on the retina, this is now uncommon. If this does occur, further surgery as soon as possible can put the retina back in place. The ophthalmologist will monitor your baby's eye very carefully after surgery. This will include checking the health of your child's eye(s), the eye pressure, the focusing power of the eye, as well as vision. Your child\u2019s glasses or contact lenses must be kept up to date to ensure the developing brain is being shown a clear image. If your baby develops a complication the ophthalmologist can often treat it and will try to save as much sight as possible. The chances of your baby developing a complication are usually low. If you notice any swelling, bleeding, a lot of stickiness, redness in or around your baby's eye, or if they seem to be in pain after surgery contact the hospital immediately, or go to the Accident and Emergency department (A&E), so your child can be seen quickly. These complications can often be treated successfully if they are caught early enough. If you have any concerns about your child\u2019s eye or post-operative care, contact the hospital where the surgery took place. Parents and carers will often be given 24-hour contact details before leaving the hospital. Strabismus Strabismus (squint) can develop if the eyes are not working properly together. If your child has a squint or amblyopia (described later in this section), these conditions may be managed by an orthoptist at the hospital. Orthoptists are experts in how the two eyes work together (known as binocular vision) and this includes the assessment of squints, double vision, and amblyopia. If your child is suspected to have any of these conditions, they are usually one of the first professionals they will see if they are referred to the hospital. Orthoptists are extremely skilled in testing vision in young children, diagnosing strabismus, prescribing patching therapy and any eye exercises that may help. Nystagmus This is when there is uncontrolled movement of the eyes. The movements are usually side to side but can also be up and down or in a circular motion. Amblyopia (lazy eye) can develop when the brain switches off from the eye with worse vision and just switches on to the eye with the better vision. Glasses and patching can help. Patching the stronger eye encourages your child to use their weaker eye which is known as occlusion therapy. This is an important treatment to help develop your child\u2019s vision and prevent amblyopia; however, this can be a lengthy process and very demanding for both the child and parent. Your child's \u201cstronger\u201d eye may be patched for several hours a day in early childhood. Patching aims to encourage your baby's visual system in the \u201cweaker\u201d eye to develop. It is important to follow prescribed timings for patching. Some parents may feel that extra time patching may benefit but this would only cause problems with normal vision development in the good eye. If the orthoptist\u2019s patching advice is strictly followed there is a better the chance of your baby developing the best vision possible in the weaker eye. If cataracts have been removed in both eyes and one eye sees better than the other, patching the better seeing eye for short periods may be recommended. The specialist may advise you to patch your baby's stronger eye even if they have not had cataract surgery. If your baby's cataract is not dense or large enough to be removed by surgery patching the stronger eye can help your baby's brain to switch onto the eye with the cataract. There are different types of \u201cpatches\u201d that can be used; some can be stuck onto the face and others can be put over glasses or worn \u201cpirate style\u201d. The orthoptist could explore which ones would work best for your child Techniques to encourage your child to wear their patch could include reward charts/stickers, associating patching with enjoyable activities such as games, music, etc. Continue to be persistent and consistent with patching. Asking teachers, family members and friends to help and encourage your child may also help them understand that it is something that must be done. If wearing a patch is not possible then sometimes drops can be put in the stronger eye to blur vision for a period of time, rather than wearing a patch. The orthoptist at the hospital will be able to advise on the various ways to help a child to develop their vision as much as possible, such as glasses and patching. With early detection and treatment as well as the dedication of parents and carers, many children with congenital cataracts in the UK go on to have a good level of vision for the remainder of their lives. Parents and carers of children with congenital cataract(s) put in a tremendous amount of effort, commitment, and persistence during their child\u2019s treatment and this will be rewarded with better visual outcome for most children. Children with unilateral cataract can have reduced vision in that eye but if vision is normal in the unaffected eye, then overall vision is very good. Even with reduced vision in one eye, children can adapt very well to using their better eye. This doesn\u2019t mean that they will be overusing their better eye or causing any damage to the better eye. It\u2019s unusual for children with good vision in one eye to need additional support in their education. People with good vision in only one eye can drive a car if the vision in that eye can meet the visual standards for driving. Children with bilateral cataracts may have better vision in each eye compared to those with cataract in unilateral eye but often vision is still affected. Most will attend mainstream school but may require additional support. Your child will likely have better sight if they don\u2019t have any other eye condition or experience complications following surgery. It is important for your child to continue to have regular eye checks with the hospital or with an optometrist. This ensures your child is wearing the right type and strength of glasses or contact lenses, so their vision develops as well as possible. The hospital will advise you on how often your child should have an eye examination. Children with cataract may have other eye or health problems. These are usually detected by a heath care professional early on, with treatment or support given where needed. Talk to your eye team or GP if you have any other concerns. On hearing that your child has issues with their sight, you may feel like your world has been turned upside down. Different people respond in different ways but it\u2019s natural to experience many emotions which may include shock, fear, grief, sadness, or despair. All these feelings are quite common and part of the process you may go through during the early weeks and months. You may have left the consulting room in a daze and may not have heard all the words that were said to you during the consultation. You may be asking yourself what happens next and what the future holds for your child. Different feelings come and go and can catch up with you when you least expect it. All the while your child\u2019s need for food, love, warmth and security continue to demand your energy, care and attention. But the first step is to make sure you have access to all the information and help that is available. You probably have a million different questions. You will want to know which organisations can help you, what resources are available or simply want to know \u201cwhat do I do next?\u201d You may also want to meet other parents who have been through a similar experience. It\u2019s a good idea to write down any questions that come to your mind on some paper and take it along when attending eye clinic appointments. This will ensure that you don\u2019t forget to ask the medical team about them during your visit. Your local authority (LA) should have at least one qualified teacher of visually impaired children (QTVI) to work with you and your child both at home and at school. QTVI are qualified teachers who can provide support with development, play, learning and education. At an early stage, ask your local authority to put you in contact with a QTVI. Your child\u2019s eye hospital may also have an Eye Care Liaison Officer (ECLO) who can help. The ECLO and QTVI will support you and your child as soon as a vision impairment is suspected or diagnosed. If you have difficulty getting help or need the details of the specialist teacher in your area, contact RNIB Helpline on 0303 123 9999.

        "summary": "Corneal dystrophies are a rare group of genetic conditions which cause changes to the cornea without any inflammation, infection, or other eye disease.",
        "content": "Abnormal material accumulates in the cornea affecting the clarity (transparency) of your cornea. They usually involve both eyes. Although corneal dystrophies often get worse over time, normally this happens very slowly. Many corneal dystrophies develop so slowly that they may never get to a point where they affect your vision. Corneal Dystrophies may not cause any symptoms. Sometimes affected individuals experience glare, pain or discomfort, light sensitivity, dry eye and in some cases a reduced level of vision. This page contains a summary of our information on corneal dystrophies. To read our full information, download our factsheet: Corneal dystrophies can often run in families, but this is not always the case. In some cases, it may not be possible to say why someone has developed their corneal dystrophy. Corneal dystrophies can be passed down in your genes. Genes usually come in pairs. You inherit one gene from each of your parents to make each pair. When you have children, you only pass on one gene to them. There are two ways that corneal dystrophies can be inherited (passed on in families): Autosomal Dominant inheritance. This means that one parent actually has the condition. Each time that parent has a child there is a 50 per cent (one in two) chance of the child having the condition as well. Autosomal Recessive inheritance. This means that neither parent has the condition themself, but both parents are \u201ccarriers\u201d. If two carriers have children, there is a 25 per cent (one in four) chance that each child will have the condition. Both parents need to be carriers of the condition for their child to be affected. The cornea is made up of five layers. Each layer has a different role in keeping the cornea healthy and clear. Corneal dystrophies can be described in many ways, but because each dystrophy will start by affecting a particular layer of the cornea, they are often classified by layers of the cornea they affect. The layers of the cornea from the outer part of the eye inwards, or front to back, are the epithelium, Bowman\u2019s layer, the stroma, Descemet\u2019s membrane, and the endothelium. The epithelium is the thin outermost layer of the cornea. It is a barrier protecting the rest of the cornea and the inside of the eye from foreign bodies, such as grit, and from infections. The epithelium is filled with tiny nerve endings that make the cornea very sensitive to touch. The epithelium also provides an extremely smooth surface, which is essential for good vision. A common symptom of corneal dystrophies that affect the epithelium is a painful \u201cforeign body\u201d sensation, which can feel like there is something in your eye. This can occur if there is a change in the cornea which disturbs the epithelium. If the surface epithelial layer breaks down, the sensitive nerve endings become exposed, causing a foreign body sensation. This breakdown of the corneal surface is known as an \u201cerosion\u201d and causes a similar feeling to when an eyelash or a piece of grit gets into the eye, but in some cases can be a lot more painful. The epithelium can heal quickly so you may not experience these symptoms for very long. Treatment can also be given to relieve your symptoms and aid healing. Epithelial basement membrane dystrophy is the most common epithelial dystrophy. It doesn't usually run in families. However, very rarely, it is passed on in a family by dominant inheritance. Most people have no symptoms but about 10 per cent of people who have this dystrophy go on to develop recurrent corneal erosions. As well as symptoms of foreign body sensation, recurrent corneal erosions can cause pain, light sensitivity, blurred vision, redness and watering and you may not be able to open the affected eye. Most people who have these symptoms are over 30 years of age. Erosions occur because this dystrophy changes the \u201cbasement\u201d or anchoring layer of the epithelium, which can cause small areas of the epithelium of the cornea to become detached. When an optometrist (optician) or ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) examines your cornea these erosions can look like areas of land on a map, dots or fingerprints. This is why this dystrophy is also known as map dot fingerprint dystrophy. Although corneal erosions can be painful, they normally heal very quickly, sometimes within hours of the erosion happening. If you have corneal erosion, then you will usually have treatment to relieve pain and allow the cornea to heal. The treatment you will be given will depend on how bad the erosion is and whether you have had many erosions before. If you need treatment this will usually be eye drops to dilate (enlarge) your pupil. These drops will blur your vision but help to reduce pain by keeping the movement of your iris and ciliary body muscles inside of the eye to a minimum by paralysing these muscles while your cornea heals. Antibiotic eye drops can be added during acute flare-ups to help prevent infection as well as lubricating eye drops, gels, or ointments to make your eyes feel more comfortable and prevent the inside of your eyelids sticking to or damaging the epithelium. Typically, corneal erosions can flare up from time to time and settle again without causing any long-term problems with your sight. If you have very frequent severe erosions, other treatments may be needed to allow your cornea to heal, such as specialised \"bandage\" contact lenses which are worn long term to keep the eye comfortable, or \"debridement\" (where loose tissue is removed from the surface of your cornea). Debridement can be carried out manually, using blunt instruments or be automated, using lasers (excimer) to remove damaged tissue. Debridement can provide improvement in clarity of vision as well as comfort of the eye in some people. Most people with this type of corneal dystrophy do not have sight problems and everyday activities such as driving, or reading are not typically affected in the long term. It is very rare for someone with an epithelial basement membrane dystrophy to need a corneal transplant. This is a very rare corneal dystrophy and is passed on in a family by dominant inheritance. This condition causes tiny round pockets of fluid, known as microcysts to form in the epithelial layer of your cornea. These develop early in life, sometimes within the first year and can increase in number over time. Meesman\u2019s dystrophy usually affects both eyes. The microcysts do not normally cause any symptoms until late adolescence or adulthood, when they can start to break open (rupture) on the surface of the cornea and cause discomfort. These changes may make you light sensitive, cause your eyes to water and feel like you have something in your eye. Some people may experience temporary episodes of blurred vision. This dystrophy may also make it difficult to wear contact lenses. Meesman\u2019s dystrophy is usually treated with eye drops to lubricate the front of the eye to help reduce symptoms and make your eyes more comfortable. Although people can have temporary flare-ups when microcysts rupture, Meesman\u2019s dystrophy does not worsen over time so other treatments are not normally required. The stroma is the middle layer of the cornea. It makes up around 90 per cent of your cornea\u2019s thickness. The stroma is made up of water and a material called collagen, which is arranged in regular fibres. This regular arrangement of collagen fibres means that the stroma is clear and also very tough and elastic. Stromal dystrophies cause deposits to build up in this layer. These deposits make your stroma less clear, affecting vision. Changes in your stroma can also affect other layers of your cornea causing corneal erosions to develop. Reis-B\u00fccklers dystrophy is a very rare condition that often starts in childhood around the age of four or five or in early adulthood. Reis-Bucklers dystrophy is thought to have the dominant pattern of inheritance. Reis-B\u00fccklers dystrophy affects Bowman's layer of the cornea. Bowman's layer is the top layer of the stroma, separating it from the epithelium. In this dystrophy the tissue that makes up the Bowman's layer and the basement layer of the epithelium changes, resulting in irregularly shaped opacities in the stroma, causing painful erosions to develop. Over time, although the erosions may settle down the surface of the cornea can become hazier, affecting sight. Reis Buckler dystrophy affects both eyes equally. The changes it causes tend to be in the middle of the cornea, so they are more likely to affect your vision. Reis-Bucklers corneal dystrophy can also cause a loss of sensation (feeling) to the surface of your cornea, which could mean you may not be aware if something goes in your eye, or if your cornea has been damaged. This could lead to further damage. Treatments for Reis-Bucklers corneal dystrophy can include removing scar tissue from the surface of your cornea (epithelial debridement) or laser eye surgery to remove the cloudy area of the cornea. If Reis-Bucklers dystrophy causes very poor vision, a corneal transplant may be needed. Lattice dystrophy is the most common dystrophy affecting the stroma. It is passed on in a family by dominant inheritance and usually begins before the age of 20 years. Early symptoms tend to be a \u201cforeign body\u201d sensation, which can feel like there is something in your eye and a slight change in vision. Some people may experience painful corneal erosions, but others have no symptoms. Lattice dystrophy causes material to build up on the cornea in a lattice (grid) pattern. When your eye is examined under a microscope, called a slit lamp, very fine glassy-looking overlapping lines and dots can be seen in your cornea looking like \"cracked glass\". As the dystrophy progresses, these lines become thicker and may make the cornea hazy affecting your sight. If you have a foreign body sensation and erosions then you will be given treatment for these, which might include lubricating eye drops and/or antibiotic eye drops. If you experience serious sight loss, laser treatment or corneal transplant might be required. This dystrophy affects both eyes and is passed on in a family by dominant inheritance. Changes to your cornea usually begin before the age of 20. In the early stages vision isn\u2019t affected, but when your eyes are examined using a slit lamp, small white deposits, which look like crumbs, sugar granules, rings or snowflakes can be seen in your cornea. Slowly, over time these deposits increase in number and join becoming larger and noticeable without a slit lamp. Vision is not usually severely affected under the age of 50, but as the dystrophy worsens you may experience frequent painful recurrent erosions and also glare and light sensitivity because of the increase in deposits. If you develop erosions and your eyes are painful or uncomfortable, lubricating eye drops can be given to help soothe your eyes and allow the cornea to heal. If the erosions are very frequent and not helped with drops, you may need laser treatment to remove some of the deposits and smooth the surface of the cornea to try to prevent or lessen these. Your cornea may also become less sensitive to touch and pain due to the dystrophy. This can mean that you may not be aware that you are developing erosions or that your cornea is damaged. Painful recurrent erosions can increase the haziness of the stroma, and this can lead to further reduced vision. If you experience serious sight loss due to granular dystrophy, a corneal transplant may be required. This dystrophy is passed on in a family by recessive inheritance, which makes it less common, but more severe, than other stromal dystrophies. Macular corneal dystrophy causes dense greyish-white deposits to form in the stroma. With time more and more of these deposits develop eventually causing the whole stroma to become cloudy. These changes also cause the cornea to become thinner and irregular in shape. As well as reducing vision, macular corneal dystrophy can also make someone sensitive to light and cause painful erosions to develop. Often between the ages of 20 to 40 there will be serious sight loss due to this dystrophy. You may need a corneal transplant. The endothelium is an extremely thin single layer of cells, which makes up the innermost layer of your cornea. This layer is vital for keeping the cornea clear, as it acts as a pump controlling the movement of fluids and nutrients in and out of your cornea. Without this pump, the cornea can swell with fluid and become hazy. This layer cannot repair itself, so conditions that affect the endothelium can cause swelling of the cornea that can lead to serious sight loss. Fuchs corneal endothelial dystrophy is passed on in a family by dominant inheritance. As a normal part of getting older, a small number of endothelial cells are lost. This does not normally cause any changes in vision. In Fuchs dystrophy, this process speeds up and more cells than usual are lost. Eventually, enough cells are lost that the endothelium doesn\u2019t work well enough to prevent fluid soaking into the cornea or as a pump to remove it. This causes the cornea to swell due to the build-up of fluid, known medically as \u201coedema\u201d. This oedema can affect vision. Fortunately, Fuchs dystrophy develops slowly. It is normally detected when someone is in their fifties or sixties. Not everyone who is diagnosed with it experiences problems with their vision. As it develops it can cause sensitivity to light and can make vision cloudy. If the changes to your sight are starting to cause you difficulties, your specialist may recommend that you have a corneal transplant. It's completely natural to be upset when you have been diagnosed with a corneal dystrophy and normal to find yourself worrying about the future and how you will manage with a change in your vision.

        "summary": "A corneal transplant is surgery to remove all or part of a damaged cornea and replace it with healthy, clear cornea tissue from the eye of a donor who has died. A corneal transplant is often referred to as a keratoplasty or a corneal graft.",
        "content": "This page contains a summary of our information on corneal transplant. To read our full information, download our factsheet: If your cornea is scarred, damaged, or distorted to a point where the vision can no longer be improved with glasses or contact lenses, you may need a corneal transplant to provide clear vision once more. A corneal transplant can also be used to relieve any pain or discomfort caused by severe infection or injury that is no longer being managed effectively with treatment. Your ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) will discuss with you how a corneal transplant will help, and they should help you make the decision on whether and when to have your transplant. Surgery for a corneal transplant usually takes around an hour, although depending on the type you are having, it may take up to two hours to complete. Transplant surgery can be done under either under local anaesthetic, where you are awake, or general anaesthetic, where you are unconscious and unaware. If you have a local anaesthetic, you will usually have an injection into the soft tissue around your eye, not into your eye itself. You will also be given eye drops to numb the front of the eye. The injection stops you feeling pain from your eye, reduces what you can see and stops your eye from moving around. You will need to be able to lie still for the whole operation to be suitable for local anaesthetic. If you have local anaesthetic, you might be offered sedation, medication which makes you feel sleepy and relaxed during the surgery. Sedation can make the surgery less stressful and more comfortable for you. Your doctor would be able to explore whether sedation would be right for you. Your eye should not be too painful following the surgery, but if there is any discomfort you may be given painkillers such as paracetamol. The sutures in your eye may make your eye feel gritty, but these should not be uncomfortable or painful. If they are, it would be important to contact the hospital about this. Following surgery your eye will be patched. You can usually go home either the same day or next day but will have to go back within the first week to have your eye checked by your ophthalmologist. During this time, you may need to wear a plastic shield at night to protect your eye while you are asleep. You will need to use steroid eye drops for at least one year and in some cases, life-long to prevent your immune system from rejecting the new donor corneal layers. You might need to take other medicines to suppress your immune system if your ophthalmologist feels that there is a high risk of rejection. After surgery you\u2019ll been given antimicrobial eye drops for a few weeks to prevent infection. You ophthalmologist will advise you how often you will need to use all these medicines and for how long. After the first week\u2019s check-up, you would typically be seen again within a month and then every three months for the first year. Depending on the type of transplant you have, after the first one to two years, further appointments may not be needed. Some people who have had a corneal transplant will need life-long check-ups. There are three types of corneal transplant. EK \u2013 Endothelial Keratoplasty which removes and replaces the innermost layers of the cornea DALK \u2013 Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty which removes and replaces part of the front layers of the cornea PK \u2013 Penetrating Keratoplasty which removes and replaces all the layers of your cornea. The type of transplant you will be offered depends on the layers of your cornea that are affected. EK replaces only the innermost layers of the cornea, making it suitable for corneal dystrophies and conditions solely affecting the endothelial layer of the cornea, such as Fuchs endothelial dystrophy. EK surgery is usually carried out under both local and general anaesthesia and takes about an hour. There are two main types of EK transplants, which require different preparation: Descemet's stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK), also known as a 'DSAEK' where the 'A' stands for automated In DSEK you receive a replacement endothelium and Descemet's membrane, as well as some of the stroma from a donor cornea. Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) In DMEK you receive only the endothelium and Descemet's membrane from a donor cornea. Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) is most widely used. In DALK surgery, the surgeon removes the corneal epithelium, Bowman\u2019s membrane, and stromal layers from the centre of your cornea, leaving in place Descemet\u2019s membrane and the innermost endothelial layer. Your ophthalmologist then places a specially prepared donor cornea (\"button\") containing stroma and epithelium onto your cornea. The donor button is cut so that it fits precisely into the area of your cornea which was removed. This donor cornea position is secured by tiny sutures until it heals in place. DALK usually takes about a year to heal. Some stitches may be removed before this, but usually not before the first six months. PK is a \"full thickness\" transplant. PK is more likely to be offered if the stroma and endothelium of your cornea are damaged, for example in keratoconus. During PK your whole cornea is replaced by a donor cornea which is held in place with sutures. Corneal transplant sutures are made of nylon which is non-absorbable and provides long lasting good tensile strength in tissues. Sutures are usually left in place for a year or more following surgery. EK is \"keyhole\" surgery, which is quick to heal. By transplanting a thinner layer of tissue in DMEK, recovery times are faster than for DSAEK, the visual results are better, and the rejection risk is lower at only one per cent for DMEK, compared to seven to eight percent for DSAEK and 13 percent for a full thickness \u2018penetrating keratoplasty\u2019 (PK) transplant. Your ophthalmologist would be able to explain whether a DSAEK or DMEK transplant would be right for you. Sometimes, the donor layer can detach from the back of the cornea. This usually happens in the first days following an EK transplant. If this happens, you will need to have a small procedure to inject a further air bubble into the eye to help the transplanted tissue to reattach. This is known as \"rebubbling\". Both DALK and PK transplants work well. About 90 per cent of DALK and PK transplants carried out for keratoconus are functioning well after five years. Newer DALK transplants also seem to have an even lower risk of failure, to last for longer and to have shorter recovery times compared to PK transplants. Although PK transplants are an effective treatment, 50 per cent are no longer working at 20 years. This means that if you\u2019re younger you might be advised to wait longer before having a corneal transplant, as you are more likely to require a number of transplants in your lifetime. The risks of failure of both PK and DALK are low for most corneal conditions, but after both types of surgery it can take a long time for vision to recover. You will need to wear glasses and sometimes contact lenses after the transplant to get the best possible vision. Following a transplant, you will need to use steroid eye drops for at least one year, and in some cases indefinitely, to prevent rejection of the transplanted donor cornea. Transplants also carry the risk of cataracts, the clouding of the lens in your eye, and glaucoma, a condition where pressure at the front of your eye damages the optic nerve at the back of your eye. These risks are partly due to the need for steroids following the surgery. Corneal transplants are an effective treatment, but sometimes following surgery, your body\u2019s immune system recognises the transplanted donor tissue as foreign tissue and starts to react against it. This is known as corneal transplant rejection. Corneal transplant rejection can usually be reversed if it is diagnosed, and treatment commences early enough. It is usually possible to treat corneal transplant rejection with anti-inflammatory eye drops, usually corticosteroids. Corticosteroids work by reducing the activity of your immune system so that it no longer releases the chemicals which cause inflammation. You may require steroids both topically and by injection to treat the rejection. The risk of corneal transplant rejection varies according to the type of transplant and the presence of risk factors. This risk can be assessed by your ophthalmologist who will be familiar with your condition. Repeated problems with rejection can lead to the transplant failing and the need for repeat surgery. Being diagnosed with an eye condition can be very upsetting. You may find that you are worried about the future and how you will manage with a change in your vision.

        "summary": "Diabetes is a lifelong condition and can cause several health complications. Your eyes are one part of your body that can be affected.",
        "content": "It\u2019s possible that your diabetes won\u2019t cause any changes to your vision. However, diabetes can affect your eyes in several ways. This page contains a summary of our information on diabetes-related eye conditions. To read our full information, download our Understanding Eye Conditions Related to Diabetes guide, which is accredited by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists: The changes in blood sugar levels caused by diabetes can affect the lens inside your eye, especially when your diabetes isn\u2019t controlled. These changes can result in your vision blurring, which can change throughout the day and from day to day, depending on your blood sugar levels. Diabetes can cause the lens in your eye to become cloudy. This condition is known as a cataract. If you have diabetes, you\u2019re more likely to develop a cataract, and diabetes can cause cataracts to develop at an earlier age. Some people with diabetes may develop glaucoma, an eye condition that can cause damage to the optic nerve, often due to raised pressure inside the eye. Over time, diabetes can affect the network of blood vessels supplying the retina at the back of the eye, affecting how the retina works. This is known as diabetic retinopathy. There are different types of diabetic retinopathy and how it can affect vision will depend on the severity of the changes to the blood vessels. Diabetes can also be associated with or increase the risk of other eye conditions including retinal vessel occlusion, corneal eye conditions or eye muscle problems. Not everyone who has diabetes develops an eye condition. Diabetes can cause blood vessels in the retina to become blocked, to leak or to grow incorrectly. The type of diabetic retinopathy you have depends on how badly your blood vessels are affected by diabetes. There are different types of retinopathy: Background diabetic retinopathy: Background retinopathy does not usually affect your sight, but your eyes will need to be monitored carefully to make sure your retinopathy doesn\u2019t become worse. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy: If background retinopathy gets worse, many of the retinal blood vessels become damaged or blocked. When these changes affect a large area of your retina, blood supply to the retina is reduced. The body tries to fix this by growing new blood vessels on the retinal surface or into the vitreous gel. Unfortunately, these new vessels are weak, and they bleed very easily, which may affect your vision. Diabetic maculopathy and diabetic macular oedema: Diabetic maculopathy is when your macula is affected by retinopathy. If the blood vessels near the macula are leaky, fluid can build up at the macula and cause macular swelling. This is called diabetic macular oedema (DMO) and it can cause vision to be blurred and distorted, as well as making colours appear washed out. If your diabetes is well controlled, you\u2019re less likely to have problems, or they may be less serious. However, some people with diabetes do have serious sight loss because of their retinopathy. You can reduce your risk of developing retinopathy, or help to stop it from getting worse, by: Keeping your blood glucose or blood sugar level within normal levels. Tightly controlling your blood pressure. Controlling your cholesterol levels. Keeping fit and maintaining a healthy weight. Giving up smoking. Nerve damage, kidney and cardiovascular disease are more likely in smokers with diabetes. Smoking increases your blood pressure and raises your blood sugar level, which makes it harder to control your diabetes. Having regular retinal screening. The most effective thing you can do to prevent sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy is to go to your retinal screening appointments. Early detection and treatment can stop you from losing sight. If you or your family are from a South Asian or African-Caribbean background, you\u2019re two to four times more likely to get type 2 diabetes. The factors behind this aren\u2019t fully understood but are thought to involve insulin problems, genes, diet, and lifestyle. The factors behind this aren\u2019t fully understood but are thought to involve insulin problems, genes, diet and lifestyle. Diabetes and the eye As well as being more at risk of developing diabetes, people from these communities who are already diabetic tend to be at a higher risk of developing diabetic complications of the eye \u2013 called diabetic retinopathy. This can seriously affect your sight. Diabetic retinopathy can be treated with laser treatment to prevent sight threatening complications. Laser can be used in two ways: Localised laser treatment may be used when only a small part of your retina is affected by retinopathy. The laser seals your blood vessels, to stop them from bleeding and help to reduce swelling. The treatment normally only takes a few minutes. You don\u2019t usually notice a worsening of your vision after this procedure because only a small patch of your retina is treated with the laser. Pan-retinal laser treatment. When new blood vessels begin to grow (a process known as neo-vascularisation), a larger area of your retina may need to be treated by laser. Treating more of your retina stops it from producing the growth factors that make new blood vessels develop. When the treatment is successful, the new blood vessels get smaller and disappear over a few months. Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) can be treated with anti-VEGF treatment. This is usually given when your macula has swollen to a certain size. Anti-VEGF treatment can help to improve your vision by reducing your macular oedema and helping the fluid to be reabsorbed. If you have sight loss, you may find that this makes managing and monitoring your diabetes at home more difficult. You can find helpful information on staying independent with sight loss can be found in our Making the Most of Your Sight guide.

        "summary": "Dry eye is an eye condition caused by a problem with your tears.",
        "content": "If you live in the UK and have been diagnosed with dry eye, we would like your views about our information on dry eye. Your views will help us make our information as useful as possible for other people diagnosed with this condition. We would like to hear from you if you are happy to: Read our information on dry eye (download the factsheets in either PDF and Word format below). Answer a few questions over the phone or by email about how helpful the current content is, based on your experience of the condition, and how our information could be improved. To find out more please contact the RNIB Eye Health Information team on 020 7391 3299 or email [email\u00a0protected]. Dry eye can make your eye feel uncomfortable, red, scratchy and irritated. Despite the name, having dry eye can also make your eyes watery. Typically, dry eye doesn\u2019t cause a permanent change in your vision. It can make your eyesight blurry for short periods of time, but the blurriness will go away on its own or improve when you blink. This page contains a summary of our information on dry eye. To read our full information, download our Understanding Dry Eye guide, which is accredited by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists: Dry eye is caused by a problem with your tears. You can develop dry eye if you don\u2019t produce enough tears, or the tears aren\u2019t of the right quality or if they don\u2019t spread across the front of your eye properly. Dry eye is usually more common as people get older. As we age, our eyelids aren\u2019t as good at spreading tears each time we blink. The various glands in our eyes that produce tears may also become less effective. It is not always known what causes your eye to become dry but essentially, the quality of something known as your tear film gets worse. When you blink, you spread a thin layer of liquid, called the tear film, over the front surface of your eye. The tear film keeps the front surface of your eye healthy, and it also helps the eye focus properly, giving you clear vision. The tear film is made up of three layers: the mucin (mucous) layer, the aqueous (watery) layer, and the lipid (oily) layer. Each one of these layers is needed to keep your tear film healthy. Anything that affects the structure and balance of your tear film \u2013 for example if you produce too little or too much of one of the layers \u2013 will stop the tear film working properly and potentially cause dry eye. It is sometimes difficult to determine the exact cause of dry eye. Dry eye is multifactorial, which means that that there can be many factors that contribute to the condition. Sometimes dry eye can be connected to other conditions affecting your body such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. The condition is common in both men and women with advancing age but women in particular, especially after the menopause. Changes in hormonal levels such as in pregnancy and menopause can contribute to dry eye. The following can also affect your tear film and contribute to dry eye: Blepharitis and meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) are the most common causes of dry eye. Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid margins and can sometimes be caused by a bacterial infection. It can be divided into two types based on the location: Anterior blepharitis is when the inflammation is primarily around the eye lashes and in front of the lid margin. Posterior blepharitis is when there is inflammation present behind the eye lashes and is often caused by MGD. MGD happens when the glands lining your upper and lower lids are blocked. You have about 30 of these small meibomian glands on each upper and lower lid located just behind your lashes. These glands secrete the oily layer onto the front of your tears. If the oil is of poor quality or there isn\u2019t enough oil being produced as the glands have become blocked, the tears tend to evaporate quickly leaving your eyes dry and uncomfortable. If you\u2019re taking certain drugs, such as antihistamines, antidepressants, pain medications and oral contraceptives, you may develop dry eye symptoms. Eye drops which contain preservatives may also contribute to dry eye, especially if you are using them frequently. Using contact lenses can cause you to develop dry eye. The length of time you wear your contact lenses along with other factors such as using computer screens, air pollution and wearing make-up can make the symptoms of dry eye worse. You should follow the advice for wearing contact lenses issued by your optometrist in terms of replacement frequency, wearing time and cleaning regime. There are several health conditions, particularly inflammatory conditions, that are associated with dry eye, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome is a condition that may cause you to have dry eye and a dry mouth. If you have surgery on your eye (for example laser eye surgery) or an accident which affects or scars your eye, you may develop dry eye. Your dry eye symptoms usually improve once the eye has healed, but this can take time. There are environmental factors that may cause or make your dry eye symptoms worse. These include dusty or smoky environments as well as heavily polluted areas or wearing make-up. Using air conditioners in the car and office as well as heaters may make your dry eye symptoms worse. Trying to identify and address these environmental factors are often recommended as a first step in helping to reduce your dry eye symptoms. Using air purifiers and humidifiers might help. There\u2019s no cure for dry eye but there are treatments that can help your eyes feel more comfortable and keep your symptoms at bay. If your dry eye is caused by medication, then your GP may consider switching your medication to another. If your dry eye is caused by wearing contact lenses, then having a break from your lenses or asking your optometrist about trying a different type of contact lens may help the dry eye to improve. Often dry eye is caused by getting older, which can\u2019t be helped, but there is treatment that can help with your symptoms. There are three main ways to help your dry eye: making the most of your natural tears using artificial tears (eye drops) reducing the draining away of the tears. There are things that you can do yourself which may help reduce the symptoms of dry eye. High temperatures and central heating can make tears evaporate more quickly, so sometimes lowering temperatures can help. Another option would be to use a humidifier (a small machine that helps puts water into the air), which may help slow down the evaporation of your tears and keep your eyes comfortable. Many people find that their dry eye is worse when they\u2019re reading or using a computer. This is because you blink less when you are doing a task like this, giving the tears more chance to evaporate. You can try to blink more when you\u2019re doing these tasks, or use eye drops before you read, watch TV, or use a computer, as this may help to keep your eyes comfortable. There is some debate on whether diet helps with reducing the symptoms. Omega 3 and 6 as well as flaxseed oil are thought to help with dry eye. However, there isn\u2019t any largescale evidence that taking these nutrients in the form of supplements will help you. If you have blepharitis or MGD, practising lid hygiene can really help make your eyes feel more comfortable. You will need to do this twice a day for two to three weeks before you see an improvement. Removing the crusts or debris from your lashes can be helpful if you have anterior blepharitis. Thorough hand washing is required before lid hygiene or applying eye drops. Follow these steps: Wash your hands for 20 seconds. Apply enough soap to cover hands and rub your hands together. Clean the back of your hands and between the fingers. Rub your fingers and your thumb. Rub the tips of your fingers. Rinse your hands thoroughly. Dry your hands with a clean towel or paper towels. Prepare a cleaning solution of sodium bicarbonate in cooled boiled water. To do this, boil the kettle and let the water cool to room temperature. Pour out one cup of water into a clean mug or glass and add a quarter teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate. Clean both the upper and lower lids using a clean tissue (folded several times) or a cotton bud. Dip the tissue or cotton bud in the prepared solution and wring out excess water. Wipe along the lid from the nose outwards; use a clean tissue/bud for every wipe. You will need several tissues/buds for each eye. Do not dip a used tissue or bud back into the solution \u2013 use a new one each time. Wash your hands again for 20 seconds as above. Your optometrist or pharmacist may recommend pre-prepared lid wipes or cleaning solutions that you can purchase as an alternative to this that you may find more convenient to use. A warm compress is often recommended for posterior blepharitis or MGD. The heat of the compress can help to unblock the meibomian glands. Along with gentle massage and lid cleansing, the compress will help to release any oil that may be trapped in your glands. Here are the steps to follow: Wash your hands for 20 seconds using the hand-washing steps outlined above for anterior blepharitis. Apply a warm compress over your eyes for five to 10 minutes \u2013 use a clean flannel rinsed in hot water, reheating regularly to keep it warm. Use your finger or cotton bud to massage the skin towards your lashes. For your top lashes, you would be applying pressure downwards to the lashes and for the bottom lashes, you would move in an upwards direction. Follow the lid hygiene process for anterior blepharitis. Wash your hands for 20 seconds as above. As an alternative, you can also buy commercially made lid warming devices that can be heated in the microwave. These tend to stay at the correct temperature for a longer time so may be more effective. Most people with dry eye need to use some form of eye drops, also known as artificial tears. Eye drops aim to supplement and replace your natural tears and help keep the surface of the eyes lubricated. This can make the eyes feel more comfortable. They can also prevent any damage to the front of your eye, which can happen if the eye is dry for a long time. You should use your eye drops as advised. If you are having to use your drops more than four times a day, then you should let your ophthalmologist or optometrist know, as you may need a different type of drop or additional treatment to the drops you\u2019re using. There are three main types of eye drops which your GP or eye health professional may recommend or prescribe: Artificial tears Artificial tears are made by many different companies. Some people find one brand works better for them than another, though the reasons for this aren\u2019t clear. Your eye health professional may suggest a selection of different brands for you to try. It is usually best to try one type for at least a month. Most artificial tear drops can be bought over the counter from the pharmacist. Some people develop sensitivity to the preservative used in the drops, especially if they\u2019re using them a lot. This can make your eyes sore. You can ask for preservative-free eye drops if this is the case. Gels Some people may prefer to use thicker gel-like drops. The gels are made from different lubricating agents and may stay in the eye for longer. They do the same thing as ordinary drops, but you don\u2019t have to put them in as often. Ointments You may be prescribed or recommended an ointment which you can apply before going to bed to keep your eyes moist overnight. When you sleep, sometimes your eyes aren\u2019t fully closed, so tears can evaporate leaving your eyes very dry when you wake up. Ointments help stop the eyes drying out overnight so that they feel more comfortable in the morning. Ointments are usually used before bedtime because they are sticky and cause blurry vision, while eye drops are used during the day. Specialist drops In severe cases, dry eye can cause swelling or inflammation. You may be prescribed drops or ointments to help with this such as antibiotics, corticosteroids and ciclosporin. This would normally only be prescribed by an ophthalmologist. Other specialist drops, known as serum eye drops, may also be prescribed for the very few cases that require them, although this is quite rare and only considered based on someone\u2019s individual circumstances. It\u2019s possible to help dry eye by blocking up the drainage holes, called puncta, in your eyelids. Stopping the tears from draining away may help your tears stay in your eye for longer. The medical term for blocking the tear ducts is \u201cpunctal occlusion\u201d. Usually, punctal occlusion is tried for a period of time to see if it helps. The small drainage channels are blocked by small devices called punctal plugs. If it helps you with the symptoms of dry eye then the plugs are left in place. Occasionally, a permanent small surgical procedure can also be performed, if temporary blocking has been useful. Often plugs or blocking the ducts is helpful at reducing the number of drops you need to use in the eyes every day. If you\u2019ve had your tear ducts blocked you may still need to use drops, gels or ointments to protect your eyes and keep them as comfortable as possible. There are newer treatments primarily being offered in private clinics for dry eye. Some of these include moisture chamber spectacles/goggles which can help your eyes retain moisture. There are special over the counter sprays that help reduce evaporation and soothe the eyes. Another is the Lipiflow system which is a device that fits over your eye and directs heat and gentle massage to the eyelids specifically to help with blepharitis and MGD. Another possible treatment option includes Intense Pulse Light (IPL) which requires several sessions of treatment in the form of pulses of light applied to the glands around your eyes to help unblock and clear the meibomian glands. These treatments are usually available from private optometrists who specialise in dry eye and are currently not available on the NHS. For some people with dry eye, multiple treatments may be required to manage their dry eye condition and your eye health professional would have to tailor treatment based on your individual circumstances. There are new treatments being explored all the time to help with dry eye symptoms. Having dry eyes can be difficult. Eyes that are red, uncomfortable, and painful for long periods can be tiring. When your eyes first become dry, you may feel upset and worried. However, dry eye doesn\u2019t usually cause any damage to your eye and typically doesn\u2019t lead to permanent changes to your vision. There are many things that you can try to help you manage it better: Use your prescribed eye drops regularly. Finding eye drops that work for you can make a huge difference. Adjust your environment. Lowering temperature and using a humidifier may help, as central heating and air conditioning can worsen your symptoms. Avoid dusty, windy and smoky areas or use wrap-around glasses when you are exposed to these environments. Take rest periods and remember to blink often when you are using the computer, watching television, and reading. Try to have a healthy balanced diet, with flax seed as well as foods containing omega 3 and 6, such as oily fish, nuts, seeds, eggs, green leafy vegetables, etc. Avoid using eye make-up when there\u2019s infection or inflammation present, or when your eyes are sore. If you wear contact lenses, have regular eye follow-ups. You may need a break from wearing contact lenses if your eyes are dry or explore different types of lenses which may be more suitable for dry eye. Finding the right eye drops to suit you and trying different things to help cope with the symptoms of dry eye can take some time and commitment. Although there is no cure for dry eye, most people will learn how to manage their dry eye so that it doesn\u2019t have too much impact on their everyday lives. If you have any questions about dry eye, we're here for you. Just get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service. Moorfields Eye Hospital has a useful information resource called Know Your Drops, with advice and tips on the best techniques to administer eye drops and information about compliance aids.

        "summary": "Epiretinal membrane (ERM) is a condition where a sheet of naturally occurring cells develops on or above the surface of the central part of your retina, an area called the macula.",
        "content": "ERM can affect vision if this sheet of cells starts to shrink, causing the retina to wrinkle up under it. This wrinkling of the retina can then cause distortion and blurring of your vision, as well as a possible reduction in your level of sight (how far down the letter chart you are able to read). However, it doesn\u2019t cause you to lose all your vision and it isn\u2019t painful. ERM does not always cause sight problems. If you are not noticing any vision problems, then you may not need any treatment. Many epiretinal membranes do not get any worse and may never affect vision, so can just be left alone. An epiretinal membrane is sometimes described as \u201cscar tissue\u201d on the retina. Other names for this include epi-macular membrane, macular pucker or cellophane maculopathy. This page contains a summary of our information on epiretinal membrane. To read our full information, download our factsheet: Whether or not an epiretinal membrane will affect sight and how badly sight will be affected can be quite variable. In the early stages of its development, an epiretinal membrane may not cause any problems with vision. However, if the membrane shrinks and wrinkles it can cause distortion of your central vision. Your vision can seem blurred and straight lines may look wavy or bent. You may find things like reading or seeing detail difficult. When your vision is measured in the hospital eye clinic or by your optometrist (optician) you may also find that it is harder to read as far down the letter chart. Epiretinal membranes don\u2019t affect peripheral (side) vision so they do not lead to total loss of sight. ERM is most common in people over the age of 50. It is thought that most epiretinal membranes occur because of another change in the eye called posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). During this process, cells may be released and then multiply on the surface of the retina to form a sheet, which is known as an epiretinal membrane. As the numbers of these cells increase, the sheet can start to shrink and cause the retina to wrinkle. If the cause of an epiretinal membrane is unknown, not caused by PVD or another condition it is referred to as \u201cidiopathic\u201d. ERM can also be associated with other eye conditions or because of previous eye surgery. This is known as an epiretinal membrane secondary to another problem. Secondary epiretinal membranes most commonly develop after retinal detachment surgery but can also be caused by laser treatment for diabetic eye disease, treatment for retinal tears, conditions that cause changes to retinal blood vessels in the back of the eye, inflammation (swelling) in the eye and trauma. Secondary epiretinal membranes tend to affect vision more than idiopathic ERM, or ERM caused by PVD. Most epiretinal membranes affect only one eye. About 10 per cent of idiopathic epiretinal membranes affect both eyes. This means that most people who have an epiretinal membrane will not go on to develop one in the other eye. If you have an epiretinal membrane secondary to another condition, whether you will develop one in the other eye will depend on if the cause of the membrane is also present in this eye. Your ophthalmologist would be able to explore with you whether you are at risk of developing an epiretinal membrane in your other eye. There is nothing you can do to avoid getting ERM. Diet and exercise haven\u2019t been found to have any link with the development of ERM. Having an eye test at least every two years is the best way to make sure your eyes are healthy and that no new eye conditions are developing. There is nothing you can do to fix ERM yourself. Surgery is the only treatment for ERM, there are no medications or other treatments that can improve or remove it. Surgery only needs to be considered if you are experiencing difficulties with your vision. If your ERM is not causing any problems with your vision, or only affecting your vision slightly and you are managing OK, then your ophthalmologist may suggest just monitoring the membrane to see whether it worsens. Many people do not have any worsening of their ERM and may never need treatment. If your vision is affecting your everyday activities, your ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) may recommend surgery. Surgery to remove an epiretinal membrane involves a procedure called a vitrectomy. This involves the ophthalmologist making tiny cuts in your eye and inserting fine instruments to gently remove the vitreous gel from the middle of your eye. Your surgeon will then grasp and gently peel away the epiretinal membrane from the retina. There is no wrong or right time to have epiretinal membrane surgery. Some people may choose not to have surgery and to accept the distorted vision in one eye. If you have good vision in the other eye, over time you will adapt to the distorted vision in the affected eye, and this may no longer bother you. If ERM is left untreated, it will not cause any other problems in your eye. The main benefit of having surgery is that it usually improves or completely removes the distortion in your vision. Most people notice this improvement in the first month following surgery. Approximately, 80 percent of people who have surgery to remove an epiretinal membrane also have an improvement in their level of vision (how much of the letter chart they can read). It can take about two to three months after surgery for the extent of this improvement to be seen, although your vision may continue to get better for up to 6-12 months before the final level of vision is known. How well your vision is likely to recover after surgery can depend on several things, including how affected your vision was before the surgery, how long your vision has been affected for, whether there are any complications resulting from the surgery, as well as if the membrane is idiopathic or secondary to another condition. Your ophthalmologist will be able to give you an idea of how much improvement you are likely to get to help you decide whether having surgery is the right choice for you. It\u2019s completely natural to be concerned when you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ERM.

        "source": "Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy",
        "summary": "Fuchs\u2019 endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is an eye condition that affects your cornea, the clear front \"window\" of your eye.",
        "content": "The cornea is made up of different layers and it is the innermost layer called the endothelium which is affected by FECD. FECD may cause your cornea to become swollen, cloudy and sensitive to light, and your vision may decline as a result. FECD is three to four times more common in women than men, usually affects both eyes and is typically seen in people in their 40s and 50s, but it can also occur at a much earlier age or later on in life. FECD usually develops slowly and can affect people to a varying degree. While some people may never have any real problems with their vision, some may notice blurring and glare quite early on. This page contains a summary of our information on FECD. To read our full information, download our factsheet: Usually, FECD is sporadic which means that there is no family history of the condition. FECD can also be inherited, meaning that it can be passed down from parents to children. If either of your parents have FECD, there may be a 50 per cent chance of developing the condition yourself. This is known as autosomal dominant inheritance. As no treatment is required unless you are having problems with your vision, family members don\u2019t need to be screened and don\u2019t need any special additional care for their eyes other than regular routine eye examinations by their high street optometrist (optician). The condition only affects the eyes and no other parts of the body. FECD mainly affects the single layer of cells that line the back part of the cornea called the endothelium. The main function of the endothelium is to maintain the proper amount of fluid within the cornea, pumping out excess fluid and keeping the cornea clear for you to \"see\". A small number of endothelial cells are lost during normal ageing process. This does not normally cause any changes in your vision. In FECD however, this process speeds up with more cells than usual being lost. Eventually the endothelium stops working properly and fluid builds up in the cornea, leading to increased corneal thickness and swelling (oedema). Your vision then becomes cloudy and blurred. For many people with FECD, the condition progresses slowly, and they don\u2019t develop any problems with their vision. One of the first symptoms you may notice is your vision is more blurred first thing in the morning when you wake up. The cornea naturally swells slightly when your eyes are closed during sleep, and this can be worse if you have FECD. You may find that the blurriness improves as the day goes on. This improvement happens because when your eyes are open, the fluid in the cornea can evaporate from the surface of the cornea. The blurriness can get worse when the humidity level is high. Extra fluid in your cornea can make light uncomfortable and you may find it harder to see when it is very bright. You may also experience light sensitivity (glare) and see halos around lights. This can be more noticeable at night, for example, when you are driving. FECD can sometimes lead to deposits called guttata appearing at the back of the cornea. These are tiny drop-like irregular lumps in the corneal endothelium which can only be seen with a special microscope. They can cause light to be scattered, causing symptoms of glare. The fluid in your cornea may also affect how well you can pick objects out against their backgrounds, particularly if there is not a lot of contrast between them so they appear to blend together. For example, you may have difficulty seeing white rice on a white plate. This is described as having reduced contrast sensitivity. You may also find that colours appear to be washed-out. If one eye is more affected than the others, picking up objects might also become difficult. This is because reduced vision in one eye can cause loss of depth perception and three-dimensional vision. Eventually, some people may find their vision no longer improves as the day goes on. This is because they have lost a substantial number of endothelial cells. Fluid now collects in the cornea causing its layers to become swollen all the time. The epithelium (the outermost corneal layer) has many nerve endings in it. When this layer is swollen, your eyes can feel gritty and painful. If your cornea is swollen, you may also develop blisters on its surface. These are known as epithelial 'bullae' (pronounced BULL-eye). If this happens, it is known as bullous keratopathy. If one of these blisters\u2019 bursts, you may experience sharp pain and discomfort. These blisters can also cause increased light sensitivity, glare and halos around lights, as well as making your eyes water. If blisters develop, these can cause corneal scarring, which will reduce vision in the affected eye. Blisters can make the shape of the cornea uneven affecting the way light is focused into the eye, causing problems with your vision. For some people, a corneal transplant may be suggested by your ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor), particularly if your FECD is becoming more severe and treatment of your symptoms is no longer helpful. For most people, FECD is a slow developing condition and it\u2019s possible to go for a long time without experiencing any of the symptoms.  If FECD isn\u2019t affecting your sight or is only causing mild symptoms, then you won\u2019t need any treatment. Instead, your eyes may be routinely examined to monitor how the condition progresses over time. If your vision is affected mainly in the mornings, clearing through the day, then your ophthalmologist may recommend using sodium chloride drops or ointments which can help to remove excess fluid from your swollen cornea. If you experience light sensitivity due to FECD, you can limit the amount of light entering your eyes by using tinted glasses. The level of tint is largely a matter of personal choice as well as a balance between being dark enough to help with glare while still allowing enough light to make the most of your vision. Some people may find light-activated sunglasses or photochromic lenses helpful. These lenses turn darker in brighter sunlight, reducing light sensitivity. Polarised lenses may also help as they minimise glare reflected from flat surfaces such as water. Your optometrist will be able to offer more advice about this. If you\u2019re driving, it\u2019s important that you have a discussion with your optometrist about the level of tint in your glasses that is suitable for you to use and meets the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) regulations as well. If glare is an issue while driving at night, your optometrist will be able to advice whether using clear lenses with an anti-reflection coating can be helpful for you. Some people find such lenses to be effective in reducing glare when driving during the night. More information about coping with light sensitivity and glare can be found in our \u2018Light sensitivity (photophobia)\u2019 factsheet. If corneal blisters (bullous keratopathy) develop, then you may be prescribed medicines to help with the pain or discomfort they cause. You may also need to wear soft therapeutic contact lenses day and night. These act as bandages that relieve pain by protecting exposed nerve endings on the surface of your cornea and encouraging the burst blisters to heal. If the changes to your sight are starting to cause difficulties in your day-to-day activities, your ophthalmologist may recommend that you have a corneal transplant. Corneal transplants can successfully treat FECD. A corneal transplant is surgery to remove all or part of a damaged cornea and replace it with healthy, clear corneal tissue from a healthy donor. It\u2019s possible to carry out transplants which replace all or only some layers of the cornea with healthy donor tissue. A corneal transplant is often referred to as keratoplasty or a corneal graft. Your ophthalmologist would be able to explore with you when it may be suitable for you to have a corneal transplant. The common types of corneal transplant procedures to treat FECD only replace the innermost layers of the cornea. These selective corneal transplants are known as 'endothelial keratoplasty'. The commonest endothelial keratoplasty transplant used for FECD is called Descemet's stripping endothelial keratoplasty, often shortened to DSEK. This procedure is sometimes also known as 'DSAEK' where the 'A' stands for automated. In DSEK you receive a new endothelium, Descemet's membrane as well as some of the stroma from a donor cornea. A newer type of endothelial keratoplasty transplant is called Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) where only the endothelium and the Descemet's membrane from a donor cornea is used. By transplanting a thinner layer of tissue in DMEK, recovery times are faster than for DSEK or DSAEK, the visual results are better, and the rejection risk is lower at only one per cent for DMEK, compared to seven to eight per cent for DSAEK. The damaged corneal layer is removed through a small incision. Then the new healthy tissue is put in place. Just a few stitches, if any, are needed to close the incision and are usually removed around two to four weeks after the surgery. The new layers of donated tissue are kept in place with a temporary air bubble, which acts as a bandage, holding the transplanted corneal layers in place. This is either removed at the end of the surgery or left in place to help with the healing process. If this is the case, you may be asked to lie on your back as much as possible in the first few days after surgery and eventually the air bubble will be harmlessly absorbed into your eye. It can take up to six months until full improvement in your vision is seen. DSEK and DMEK generally have short recovery times, usually only a few weeks or months and the risk of having the new corneal graft being rejected after surgery is also low. Less commonly in FECD, if the stroma is scarred, someone might need to have a full thickness transplant or 'penetrating keratoplasty' (PK) where your whole cornea is replaced by a donor cornea. This type of transplant requires stitches and generally has a recovery period of about 18 months. The rejection risk of this procedure is usually in the range of 12-13 per cent. If you need a transplant, the type that may be suitable for you is likely to depend on the layers of your cornea affected by FECD. Both endothelial keratoplasty and penetrating keratoplasty procedures work very well in FECD as the condition does not come back in the transplant. Most people notice an improvement in their sight in the first six months after transplant surgery. People who have had endothelial keratoplasty are likely to experience improvements in their sight sooner than people who have had penetrating keratoplasty. This is because endothelial keratoplasty is a 'keyhole' surgery which is quick to heal and usually does not require any stitches or very few stitches. Corneal transplant is an effective treatment. However, sometimes a transplant may need to be repeated if there are problems with transplant rejection. While FECD does not re-occur in the new corneal graft, the new cells can still fail for other reasons, including rejection, trauma, infection, and natural loss of cells for example. Corneal graft rejection can occur when your body\u2019s defence or immune system recognises the transplanted tissue as foreign. It is usually possible to treat corneal transplant rejection with anti-inflammatory drops, which reduce swelling. If the graft fails, the cornea will again become swollen with clouding of vision. However, frequent problems with rejection may lead to the need for repeat transplant surgery. Although rejection is a risk and can affect about one in five of all transplants, the risk of rejection is reduced by using steroid eye drops. Across all types of corneal transplant, 75 per cent last at least five years and more than 50 per cent last up to 10 years. Advantages of endothelial keratoplasty in addition to rapid recovery include lower rejection rates and relatively easy repeat surgery if this is required. Find more information on corneal transplants. Both FECD and cataracts are more common as you get older, and this means that they can often happen together however, they do not interact and do not make each other worse. Cataracts are a very common eye condition. As you get older, the lens inside your eye gradually changes and becomes less clear and cloudy, this is known as a cataract. Over time a cataract can get worse, gradually making your vision mistier. Cataracts can be treated with a straightforward operation to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with a new artificial one, enabling you to see clearly again. Further information about cataracts and cataract surgery can be found in our \u2018Understanding Cataracts\u2019 booklet. Whilst cataract surgery is usually very successful, any surgery to the eye, including cataract surgery, can further reduce the number of healthy corneal endothelial cells in FECD. This may result in corneal decompensation (corneal swelling and cloudiness) and it sometimes needs to be followed up by, or combined with, an endothelial keratoplasty procedure. Due of this risk, it is important for someone with FECD to have their cornea examined carefully before cataract surgery is performed. Sometimes your ophthalmologist may decide that you need to have both cataract surgery and corneal transplant at the same time. Two separate surgeries are combined into one procedure and recovery time is greatly reduced. In some cases, it may be safer to let the eye settle from cataract surgery first, then have endothelial keratoplasty afterwards. As the results of DMEK are much improved nowadays, people who have FECD and symptoms due to cataracts are treated at the same stage in cataract development as those without FECD. If you are concerned about cataract surgery worsening FECD, it would be important to discuss this with your ophthalmologist. Being diagnosed with an eye condition can be very upsetting.

        "source": "Giant cell arteritis",
        "summary": "Giant cell arteritis (GCA), is a condition that affects large and medium sized arteries in your body, in particular, the arteries in your neck and head.",
        "content": "GCA is sometimes referred to as temporal arteritis, as one of the more commonly affected arteries is the temporal artery at the side of your forehead (temple). In GCA, the inner artery walls become inflamed or thickened (arteritis) with large inflammatory cells (giant cells). The inflammation causes the affected arteries to become swollen, greatly restricting the blood flow through them. If the blood flow becomes too restricted, the structures supplied by these arteries will be affected. If the artery which supplies the eye is affected, then this can cause sight loss in that eye. For this reason, GCA is considered an emergency. This page contains a summary of our information on giant cell arteritis. To read our full information, download our factsheet: The cause of GCA is unknown. It\u2019s not a common condition, and it rarely affects people under the age of 50 years old. It can affect people from 60 years of age, with the highest incidence seen in those over 70 years old. Women are more commonly affected by GCA than men. Headache One of the first signs of GCA is a new onset frequent or constant headache, that can be severe in some case, which may come on suddenly or gradually. It is often at the side of your forehead, at your temples, and it may affect one or both sides of your head. The headache associated with GCA will probably not feel like any headache you\u2019ve had before. Scalp and temple tenderness You may also feel that your temples and scalp are tender to touch, so that combing or brushing your hair feels uncomfortable. This is because the temporal artery is located close to the skin just in front of your ears and continues up to your scalp. Pain around the eyes Some people with GCA also experience pain around their eyes within the eye sockets. Pain on chewing Another early sign of GCA is pain and tiredness on chewing. This can be a cramp-like pain in your jaw which can make you stop eating. When you stop chewing the pain gets better. You may hear this referred to as jaw claudication and it is due to ischaemia in the muscles that help you to chew. Ischaemia can also cause pain in your tongue, mouth or ear. If you have any of the symptoms outlined above, you should contact your GP urgently. Vision disturbances You may experience a temporary complete loss of vision in one eye which returns after a while. This is called amaurosis fugax and it is another sign of ischaemia. You may also experience double vision that you haven\u2019t had before because the muscles controlling your eye movements may be affected. Loss of vision About 30-50 per cent of people who have untreated GCA will develop a permanent and severe loss of vision in one eye. Without immediate treatment, about a third of these people will develop sight loss in the other eye, often within a week of the first eye. Therefore, it is vital that you see an ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) immediately in A&E if you experience sudden sight loss in one eye. Sudden loss of vision should always be investigated immediately by an ophthalmologist, even if your sight returns after a while, and even if you are not experiencing any of the other symptoms of GCA. Some people lose their sight without having previously noticed any other symptom of GCA. If you experience sudden sight loss, you should go to A&E or to a hospital eye casualty department straight away to be seen urgently so that if treatment is needed, it can be given as soon as possible. Other general health issues Giant cell arteritis can be difficult to diagnose because its early symptoms resemble those of other common conditions. Some people with GCA also experience more general symptoms such as weight loss, tiredness, flu-like symptoms, night sweats, fever and depression. Usually, people have some symptoms of GCA before their sight is affected, so it\u2019s very important to see your GP straight away if you are concerned that you might have a problem. If it is suspected that you have GCA, you will be given treatment straight away, even before all the results of the diagnostic tests are obtained. This is because it\u2019s important to try to reduce any possible inflammation as quickly as possible, and to prevent blood flow in other arteries becoming restricted. There are several things that your ophthalmologist or GP will check: The artery in your temple (the superficial temporal artery) may look and feel raised so that it cannot be flattened down on your head, and you may not be able to feel a pulse there when you touch it. Blood tests which check for signs of inflammation in your blood. These blood tests are non-specific tests, meaning they don\u2019t pinpoint exactly where inflammation is in your body. Also, in some people the results are inconclusive. Therefore, other tests such as a temporal artery biopsy or an ultrasound scan are used to confirm the diagnosis. If it is suspected that you have GCA, emergency treatment will be started immediately with a high dose of steroids. Steroids are medication that reduce inflammation in the body and, if GCA is suspected, you will be given steroid tablets to take even if your test results have not come through yet. The aim of this emergency treatment is to prevent sight loss and other rare complications such as stroke. You will probably have to take steroid tablets for between 18 months and two years or even longer, with the dose being reduced gradually (tapered) over time, as the inflammation subsides. A small number of people may need to take steroids for the rest of their life. Biological therapy treatments involve the use of drugs that alter a biological process occurring in your body. With GCA, a number of proteins are produced by the body. One particular protein has been found to be very high in people who have GCA. Biological therapy treatment blocks the action of this protein so that the inflammation is reduced. This treatment is usually prescribed in addition to steroids that are being tapered (reduced over time). It is given as a weekly injection under the skin (subcutaneous), in the thigh or upper arm. The drug is injected under the skin using a pre-filled syringe or a pen device and you may need to have these injections for up to a year, but your specialist will advise you about this. Steroids can lead to several unwanted side effects when taken at a high dose for a long time. By adding biological therapy to your treatment, lower doses of steroids can be given while still controlling your GCA. If it is suspected that your sight loss is due to GCA, you may be admitted to hospital for treatment or given treatment to use at home straight away. If you are admitted, you may be given a high dose of steroids directly into your bloodstream via a drip (intravenous) over the next few days. If you are not admitted, you\u2019ll be given high dose steroid tablets to use at home and then followed up by the hospital. The high dose steroids are given to try and bring down the swelling in your arteries as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, there is no treatment available that can bring back the sight loss caused by GCA so it is unlikely that the vision you have lost will return. The aim of this treatment is to prevent further sight loss in your other eye. About half the people with GCA have another condition called polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) where the blood vessels supplying some of the larger muscles in your body are inflamed. The muscles particularly affected by PMR are those in your shoulders, neck, hips and back. These muscles can be painful and stiff, particularly on waking. It is possible to have GCA without having PMR as well. It is thought they might be different conditions with the same underlying cause, and they are both treated with steroids. If you have been diagnosed with GCA with or without sight loss, it\u2019s normal to find yourself worrying about the future and how you will manage if your vision changes. All these feelings are natural. We\u2019re here to support you every step of the way, and to answer any questions you may have \u2013 just get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service. Help to see things better If both eyes are affected by GCA or the affected eye was your good eye and you have another sight problem in your other eye, you may need to make changes or use aids to make the most of your remaining sight. This may mean making things bigger, using brighter lighting or using colour to make things easier to see. You should ask your ophthalmologist, optometrist or GP about low vision aids and getting a low vision assessment. During this assessment with a low vision specialist, you\u2019ll be able to discuss the use of magnifiers and aids to help you to see things more clearly.

        "source": "Glaucoma",
        "summary": "Glaucoma is an eye condition where your optic nerve is damaged by the pressure of the fluid inside your eye.",
        "content": "This may be because your eye pressure is higher than normal, or because of a weakness to your optic nerve. Your eye needs a certain amount of pressure to keep the eyeball healthy and in the right shape. But if the pressure is too high, it can cause your optic nerve to become damaged at the point where it leaves your eye. This damage is called glaucoma. This page contains a summary of our information on glaucoma. To read our full information, download our understanding glaucoma guide, which is accredited by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists: Do you live in the UK and have you been diagnosed with glaucoma? If so, we'd like your views on our information factsheet about glaucoma. Your views will help us make our factsheet as useful as possible for other people diagnosed with this condition. We would like to hear from you if you are happy to: Read our factsheet on glaucoma (which can be downloaded from the link above) Answer a few questions over the phone or via email about how helpful the current content is, based on your experience of the condition, and how the information in our factsheet could be improved. To find out more please contact the RNIB eye health information service on 020 7391 3299 or email [email\u00a0protected] The main types of glaucoma are: Primary open angle glaucoma, the most common type of glaucoma in the UK. It\u2019s also known as chronic open angle glaucoma which means the damage to your optic nerve and changes to your sight happen very slowly over time. Closed angle glaucoma, where damage to the optic nerve can happen very quickly due to a sudden rise in eye pressure. Normal tension glaucoma, when an eye pressure within the normal range still causes damage to the optic nerve. Secondary glaucoma, which occurs because of another eye condition, an injury to the eye or due to medication. Congenital glaucoma, when a baby is born with glaucoma. Most types of glaucoma have no symptoms, so a regular eye test is the only way to know you have the condition. You may not notice any difference in your vision because glaucoma affects your peripheral vision (also known as your side vision) first. As your peripheral vision is not as sensitive as your central vision, it\u2019s difficult to notice any early changes to your vision \u2013 but your sight is being damaged. Because you may not notice a problem until your glaucoma is more advanced, it\u2019s important to have regular eye tests as this is the only way to know if you have it. The earlier your glaucoma is picked up and treated, the more of your sight can be protected. All treatment for glaucoma aims to lower your eye pressure to prevent damage to your optic nerve and your sight. Treatment to lower your eye pressure usually starts with eye drops, and for most people with glaucoma, this is all the treatment they will ever need. These drops will need to be used long term or for life. If it\u2019s not possible to control your eye pressure with eye drops alone, your ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) may suggest laser treatment. In a very small number of people with glaucoma, where eye drops haven\u2019t been successful in keeping the eye pressure stable, or where the glaucoma is advanced, surgery may be an option. The most common surgery for glaucoma is called a trabeculectomy. Unfortunately, once sight loss occurs, it can\u2019t be reversed as there are currently no treatments which can restore the damaged nerve. However, the treatments for glaucoma can help to prevent further optic nerve damage and any further loss of sight. Some people naturally have eye pressure above the normal range, but this pressure doesn\u2019t cause any damage to their optic nerve. This is described as ocular hypertension rather than glaucoma. Some people\u2019s optic nerves stay healthy at higher-than-normal eye pressures. If you have ocular hypertension, it can increase your risk of developing glaucoma, so this needs to be monitored. Sometimes you may be prescribed eye drops to help reduce your eye pressure and reduce your risk of developing glaucoma. If this is the case, you\u2019ll be followed up at the eye clinic regularly to monitor your eye pressure. You may be discharged from the eye clinic if you don\u2019t require eye drops and tests show that there is no sign of glaucoma. However, it\u2019s important for you to visit your optometrist (optician) regularly for your eyes to be checked so that any future changes can be picked up. Most people with glaucoma use eye drops for many years or for life. Using your drops regularly helps to keep your eye pressure under control and prevents damage to your sight. Not using your drops could, in the long term, make your glaucoma unstable and lead to permanent sight loss. Unfortunately, once sight loss due to glaucoma has occurred, it is not reversible. It\u2019s also very important to attend all your appointments at the eye clinic to make sure your eye pressure stays stable. This is because changes in eye pressure have no symptoms, and without regular checks you won\u2019t be able to tell that your treatment is working. How often you need to be seen at the eye clinic will depend on how well your treatment is working. It\u2019s completely natural to be upset when you\u2019ve been diagnosed with glaucoma and it\u2019s normal to find yourself worrying about the future and how you will manage with a change in your vision. We\u2019re here to support you every step of the way, and to answer any questions you may have \u2013 just get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service. If glaucoma is picked up and treated early, you may not experience much of a change to your vision. You can carry on with everyday activities such as reading, watching television, and using the computer \u2013 these things will not make your glaucoma worse. If you do have some sight loss, a low vision assessment can explore how to make the most of your sight. This may mean making things bigger, using brighter lighting, or using colour to make things easier to see. Your GP, optometrist or ophthalmologist can refer you to your local low vision service for an assessment. You can also find out tips for making the most of your sight by downloading our guide:"

        "summary": "An inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD) is a genetic eye condition which affects the light sensitive cells in the retina at the back of your eyes, which over time, stops them from working.",
        "content": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common group of IRD, but there are others that have different names, and which may lead to different patterns of sight loss. The way in which your sight is affected depends on the type of IRD you have. Most IRDs cause progressive and permanent changes that reduce your vision, but these changes usually happen slowly, taking years to develop. This page contains a summary of our information on IRDs. To read our full information, download our Understanding Inherited Retinal Dystrophies including Retinitis Pigmentosa guide, which is accredited by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists: As RP affects the retinal rod cells first, the first symptom you\u2019ll notice is that you don\u2019t see as well as people without a sight condition in dim light, such as outside at dusk, or at night. This is often called \u201cnight blindness\u201d. People without a sight condition can usually fully adapt to dim light in 15 to 30 minutes, but if you have RP, it will either take you much longer or it won\u2019t happen at all. You\u2019ll start having problems seeing things in your peripheral vision. You may miss things to either side of you and you might trip over or bump into things that you would have seen in the past. As your RP progresses, you\u2019ll gradually lose more of your peripheral sight, leaving a central narrow field of vision, often referred to as having \u201ctunnel vision\u201d. How long your central vision is preserved will depend on the type of RP that you have. This may be into your 50s or beyond. However, advanced RP will often affect your central vision, so that reading or recognising faces becomes difficult. RP is a progressive condition, which means that your sight will continue to get worse over the years. Often, after your vision has been stable for a while, it can get worse suddenly over a short period of time. This new level of vision may then remain stable for quite some time. However, there may be further changes to your vision in the future. This may mean that you have to keep re-adapting to lower levels of sight. The type of RP that you have can affect how quickly these changes develop. There are many IRDs, some with similar symptoms to RP and some that are very different. Some IRDs affect the whole retina while others only affect the macula in the central retina. IRDs such as RP are called rod-cone dystrophies because the retinal rod cells are affected more than the retinal cone cells, but the whole retina is ultimately affected. Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is the name given to a group of more severe rod-cone dystrophies that lead to greater sight loss in very early childhood, often detected at birth. Cone-rod dystrophies affect the cones earlier and more severely than the rods so that central vision is affected more than peripheral vision. Macular dystrophies primarily affect your central vision, usually leaving peripheral vision intact. Choroidal dystrophies (also known as RPE dystrophies) mainly affect how the rod and cone cells work, but they also affect the choroid and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) which both lie underneath the retina. Peripheral vision is affected first with central vision affected later on. Choroideremia and gyrate atrophy are examples of this type of dystrophy. Some IRDs have specific names and some form part of a syndrome, such as Usher syndrome and Bardet-Biedl syndrome where, in addition to sight loss, other aspects of general health are also affected. IRDs are hereditary conditions caused by a fault (mutation) in one of the genes involved in maintaining the health of the retina. You inherit genes from your parents. Your genes give the cells in your body the instructions they need to work well and stay healthy. If a gene has a mutation, there is a fault in their instructions and the cells using those instructions don\u2019t work as they should. Having an IRD means that the faulty gene involved stops your retinal cells from working correctly and results in these cells eventually failing over time. Researchers have identified many of the genes that are associated with different IRDs, but there are still other genes to discover. About half of people with an IRD have a relative who also has the condition. The way in which these genes are passed on from one generation to another can tell you who in your family has had the condition, how severely your vision could be affected, and the chances of your children being affected. Genes usually come in pairs. You inherit one gene from each of your parents to make each pair. When you have children, you only pass on one gene to them. You can inherit IRDs in different inheritance patterns: Autosomal dominant (AD). An IRD that is passed on with AD inheritance is a condition where only one of the genes in the relevant gene pair needs to have a fault to cause the condition. This gene fault can be inherited from either your mother or your father. Usually, this parent will also have the condition. If you have an IRD that is AD, there is a 50% chance of passing on the faulty gene every time you have a child and for that child to have the condition. Autosomal recessive (AR). IRDs that are passed on with AR inheritance require both genes in the relevant pair to be faulty. This means you need to inherit one faulty gene from your mother and the other faulty gene from your father to have the condition. If your parents have one faulty gene and one normal gene, they will only be carriers of the condition and their vision will be unaffected by it. If both parents pass on the gene fault to you, you will inherit the condition and your sight will be affected. Someone who has an IRD that is AR will pass on a faulty gene to all their children. However, if these children also inherit a normal copy of the gene from their other parent, they will only be carriers of the condition. X-linked (XL). To have an X-linked IRD, the faulty gene is located on the X chromosome. For a male, who has only one X chromosome in each of his cells, if there is an XL gene fault on this X chromosome, he will have the condition. A female, who has two X chromosomes in each of her cells, may have a faulty gene on one X chromosome but a normal copy of the gene on the other. If the normal copy is enough for her to have no symptoms at all or to be only mildly affected, she is a carrier of the condition, and the inheritance pattern is X-linked and recessive in nature (X-linked recessive or XLR). X-linked IRDs can affect some women more severely but this is very rare. A man with an X-linked IRD will pass on the faulty gene to all his daughters but not to his sons. His daughters are likely to be carriers of the condition, but his sons won\u2019t be affected. About half of people with an IRD don\u2019t know of any other members of their family with the condition. This may be because their relatives were carriers of the IRD and haven\u2019t shown signs of the condition themselves. Sometimes, a person can have an IRD because the fault in the relevant gene has happened spontaneously by itself after conception, without being directly inherited from their parents. If there is no known relative in your family, it may not be possible to find out how your IRD has been inherited without the help of genetic testing to find out which genes are faulty. Genetic testing can be carried out to identify the specific faulty gene that is causing your IRD. As your test results can indicate the inheritance pattern, it can help to show how likely it is for other members of your family to have the condition as well as indicating whether you could pass on a faulty gene to your children. It may also be useful in predicting how your vision will change over time and with what speed. Genetic testing uses a blood test to look at your genes to see if any faults are present. Testing for an IRD is complicated and doesn\u2019t always identify all forms of these conditions as new gene faults are still being discovered. Ask your ophthalmologist or GP to discuss genetic testing with you. Genetic counselling aims to provide you with the information you need to understand your condition and to enable you to make informed decisions relating to it. Genetic counselling can be invaluable before genetic testing is carried out, to give you an understanding of the implications the results might have. A genetic counsellor can help you understand how a condition is passed on within your family by considering your family tree in detail, as well as offering you guidance and support in making any future decisions relating to your condition; for example, knowing the chances of passing on any condition you have can help if you are thinking about starting a family. An optometrist (also known as an optician) can examine your retina by looking into your eyes. If you have the early signs of classic RP, there will be tiny but distinctive clumps of dark pigment around your retina. Any changes to your peripheral vision can be detected by a field of vision test. If your optometrist is concerned after your eye examination, they can refer you to an ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) for more tests. There are various tests that can diagnose an IRD. These tests can also monitor how your condition changes over time. Your ophthalmologist may be able to say that you have an IRD when they\u2019ve got the results of these tests, but it may not be possible to know the specific IRD you have and what the long- term effects on your vision will be without genetic testing. Some of the tests you may need to undergo include: Examination of the retina at the back of your eye. Retinal photographs, optical coherence tomography, and autofluorescence imaging \u2013 your retina may be photographed using a special camera. By comparing the photographs taken on different visits, your ophthalmologist might be able to monitor how your condition is changing over time. Visual field test which checks how much of your peripheral vision has been affected by an eye condition. Colour vision tests. Electro-diagnostic tests which can tell your ophthalmologist how well your retina is working. They check how your retina responds electrically to patterns and different lighting conditions. Different tests can be carried out to show the results of your retina\u2019s electrical activity. These test results will indicate which layers of your retina have been affected. While much progress has been made in the past few years in the understanding of the genes involved in RP and other IRDs, there is currently no cure for these conditions. However, ongoing research funded by sight loss charities is taking place all the time and the types of treatment currently being investigated include: Gene therapy. The aim of gene therapy is to introduce normal genetic material to the affected retina which will override the fault in the gene which has caused the IRD. For this to have any chance of success, there must be some retinal cells that are still working. Gene therapy relies on knowing which specific gene is faulty as a different therapy is required for faults in different genes. Gene therapy is ongoing for many IRDs in the hope of finding future treatments. There are different approaches within gene therapy which include gene replacement, gene editing and optogenetics (see below). Gene replacement. Where normal genes created by genetic scientists are injected into the retina at the back of the eye and the genetic material is carried into the retinal tissue using a harmless virus, known as a vector. The aim is that the instructions from the normal genes will lead to vision that improves or stops getting worse. The first gene replacement therapy, Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec), has been approved as a treatment for IRDs caused by faults on the RPE65 gene. Gene editing. Where scientists \u201ccut out\u201d the faulty section of genetic material within the larger gene and replace it with a normal section instead. This approach to treatment needs further development as it is not yet precise enough to ensure that normal genes are not damaged in the process. Optogenetics. Where the aim is to make retinal cells that are not photoreceptors able to respond to light where an IRD is more advanced. Optogenetics is still in the early stages of research. Stem cell therapy. Stem cells are cells that have not yet specialised to form a specific tissue in the body. If stem cells could be turned into retinal photoreceptors, it may be possible to replace the cells that have stopped working as a result of an IRD, particularly in the more advanced stages of the condition where more cells have been affected and gene therapy would not be an option. Currently, early phase clinical trials are taking place for stem cell treatments but at the time of writing this information, there are no approved stem cell treatments available for any IRDs. Growth factors. Growth factors are chemicals that support cells to grow and repair. Research into the use of growth factors to treat retinal disease has been investigated and is ongoing to see if they may be able to preserve retinal cells for longer. However, there is currently insufficient evidence that growth factors would have any long-term benefit in preserving sight. Technology known as artificial vision. There are electronic microchips that have been successfully implanted within the human retina that are able to bypass the damaged retinal photoreceptor cells, stimulating the remaining retinal nerve fibres, which form the optic nerve. If it is also healthy, the optic nerve can conduct a signal to the brain, allowing the person to see patterns of light or outlines of objects. These implants don\u2019t bring your vision back or stop your vision from getting worse and you\u2019d still need the other aids you have, such as your cane or your guide dog. Artificial vision systems are still being investigated and there isn\u2019t a system which is able to be easily implanted which returns high levels of vision. No artificial systems are currently available on the NHS. It\u2019s completely understandable to be upset when you or a family member are diagnosed with an IRD and it\u2019s normal to find yourself worrying about the future and how you or your relative will cope. We can support you at every step, putting you in touch with the advisors you need from any of our supportive teams \u2013 just get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service. Having a progressive IRD means that you\u2019ll eventually lose sight, but there are things you can do to make the most of your remaining vision. This may mean making things bigger or smaller, depending on how your vision is affected. Using brighter lighting or using contrasting colours can make things easier to see. A low vision assessment can explore how to make the most of your sight and your GP, optometrist or ophthalmologist can refer you to your local low vision service for an assessment. Assistive technology can also help, including in-built software on smart phones and tablets, specific apps and low vision devices, as well as computer software programmes that can be installed.

        "source": "Keratoconus",
        "summary": "Keratoconus (pronounced keh-rah-toe-cone-us) is an eye condition that affects the cornea on the front of your eye. It usually starts in your teens or 20s and generally worsens over time, finally becoming stable by the time you reach 40.",
        "content": "As the condition progresses, it causes changes in the regular shape, strength, and thickness of the cornea. The way this affects your sight will depend on the severity of these corneal changes, so that some people experience fewer sight problems than others. It is usually present in both eyes, although one eye may be more affected than the other. This page contains a summary of our information on keratoconus. To read our full information, download our factsheet: In this video, Reena talks about her experience of keratoconus, including the treatment she has had. Your cornea is important for sight. A healthy cornea has a regular dome-shape and is made up of several layers. It is normally strong, smooth, and transparent. The largest, middle section of the cornea is called the stroma, and it\u2019s made up of many regular-shaped bundles of collagen which are firmly joined together, giving the healthy cornea its strength. The cornea\u2019s regular domed shape enables it to focus light to give you clear vision. If you have keratoconus, the collagen bundles are affected within your cornea, so that the cornea becomes weaker and thinner nearer its centre, or just off centre. These changes in corneal thickness lead to an outward bulging, causing an irregular cone-like corneal shape to develop. The cause of keratoconus is not completely understood. It\u2019s not caused by an infection or inflammation. Keratoconus is usually diagnosed when someone is in their late teens or early twenties, and it affects men and women equally. It is more common in non-Caucasian people. Keratoconus is not considered to be an inherited condition but for around 10% (1 in 10) of people who have keratoconus, it does affect more than one member of their family. However, most people have no family history of the condition. It\u2019s possible that people who have allergies might be more likely to develop keratoconus. Allergies can cause your eyes to become itchy and uncomfortable, making you more likely to rub them. Keratoconus can affect different people to different extents, but it does not cause blindness. In the very early stages of the condition, your vision may not be affected very much at all. However, as your keratoconus progresses and your cornea changes its shape, your vision will become more blurred. You may be more sensitive to light (photophobic) and experience glare, leading to discomfort and difficulty seeing things in brighter lit conditions. Where keratoconus is mild, you may achieve a good level of vision just by wearing glasses. However, if your cornea continues to become steeper and more cone-shaped, your sight may be better when you wear contact lenses. Contact lenses sit on the front of your eye, providing a regular front surface on the cornea and masking the irregularities due to keratoconus. Contact lens wearers with keratoconus usually wear rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses. However, there are various types of specialised contact lenses that can be fitted. Your optometrist will be able to advise which is the best option for you. Corneal crosslinking (CXL) is the only clinically proven treatment that can stop keratoconus from getting worse by stabilising the shape of your cornea, and it is available on the NHS. It is most effective in treating keratoconus in its early stages when there are signs your keratoconus is progressing. CXL works by using riboflavin drops (vitamin B2), ultraviolet A (UVA) light and oxygen to strengthen the cornea and prevent further changes in corneal shape and irregularity. The treatment aims to halt keratoconus progression so that your vision does not worsen any further. CXL is less likely to be suggested as you get older. This is because crosslinking occurs naturally as you age, typically stabilising your corneal shape by your mid-30s. For some people, combinations of CXL and a specialised laser treatment called TransPRK can be used. This combination of treatments stabilises the keratoconus to prevent further deterioration and helps to make the corneal shape more regular as well. More information on CXL can be found by downloading the keratoconus factsheet. If your keratoconus has progressed beyond the stage at which combined CXL and TransPRK are helpful, intracorneal ring segments (ICRS) can be used to improve your vision. The procedure involves implanting two C-shaped rings in the corneal stroma to flatten the central cornea and give it a more regular shape. You might also be offered CXL a few months later, as a follow-on procedure, to \u201chold\u201d the corneal shape achieved by the ICRS. Corneal hydrops is a rare complication of keratoconus which gives your cornea a milky, cloudy appearance and makes your vision get worse very quickly, even when wearing a contact lens. It occurs when the aqueous fluid from inside your eye enters your corneal stroma through breaks at the back of the cornea as your keratoconus has progressed. Your eye feels more uncomfortable, even painful, and becomes red and watery and your sensitivity to light increases. These breaks in your cornea will usually take two to three months to heal and you\u2019ll be advised not to wear your contact lenses while your eye is recovering. Your ophthalmologist might suggest injecting a special gas behind your cornea to stop further aqueous fluid from passing through it. Once the breaks have healed most people find that their vision improves again. A corneal transplant is surgery to remove all or part of a damaged cornea and replace it with healthy, clear corneal tissue from the eye of a donor who has died. Corneal transplants are very successful in treating keratoconus and remain a good treatment option if you already have advanced keratoconus. There are two types of corneal transplant which are appropriate for treating keratoconus: Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK), where only the outer layers of the cornea are replaced Penetrating keratoplasty (PK), which is a \u2018full thickness\u2019 transplant, where all the layers of your cornea are replaced. Your ophthalmologist will be able to tell you which type of corneal transplant is best for you. Being diagnosed with an eye condition can be very upsetting. You may find that you are worried about the future and how you will manage with a change in your vision. We\u2019re here to support you every step of the way, and to answer any questions you may have \u2013 just get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service Having keratoconus can mean your sight is variable from day to day or even within the same day. When your vision is reduced, you may find some tasks, such as reading written text, are made easier by making things bigger and bolder. Using contrasting colours can also help, for example, when making the edges of steps stand out. You\u2019ll be more comfortable too, if the lighting around you and the devices you\u2019re using are not causing you glare. You can also find out tips for making the most of your sight by downloading our guide: UK Keratoconus Self Help and Support Association is a registered charity that works to raise awareness of keratoconus, as well as providing information and support for people in the UK affected by the condition."

        "summary": "Light sensitivity or \u201cphotophobia\u201d is common in people diagnosed with eye conditions or sight loss.",
        "content": "Light sensitivity is where the light level in the environment is too bright and causes discomfort. For some people, this discomfort can be extreme and can further reduce their usable vision. This page contains a summary of our information on light sensitivity. Our downloadable factsheet has our full information on light sensitivity caused by eye conditions, but the ideas may also help people without any eye conditions: Glare is where bright or reflected light can affect our ability to see or is uncomfortable to look at. Many people with low vision need more light than usual to read. However, too much or the wrong sort of light can cause problems with glare. There are two types of glare - discomfort glare and disability glare. Discomfort glare occurs when a light source is just too strong for our eyes. It may cause us to \u201cscrew up\u201d or shade our eyes; it can even cause us to close our eyes. It makes us want to look away from the light source, because it is uncomfortable to look at, but it doesn\u2019t cause a reduction in vision. Disability glare reduces how well we can see. Disability glare can be caused by eye conditions and can occur with ordinary light sources and levels of light. Disability glare doesn\u2019t necessarily cause discomfort but can reduce how much detail we can see. This type of glare generally reduces contrast, making it difficult to distinguish objects. Many eye conditions can cause light sensitivity and glare, some examples include: Ocular albinism \u2013 this is when some people are born with a lack of pigment in the eye. Aniridia \u2013 a condition where the iris is missing from birth. Cataracts \u2013 clouding of the lens inside the eye. Macular degeneration \u2013 a condition affecting the macula, the area in the eye responsible for our central, detailed vision. Uveitis \u2013 inflammation inside the eye, such as iritis. Inherited retinal dystrophies such as retinitis pigmentosa. Conditions which affect the front surface of the eye such as conjunctivitis, dry eye or corneal problems. If you start to experience light sensitivity, it\u2019s important to see an optometrist (also known as an optician) to have your eyes checked. An optometrist will be able to examine the health of your eyes to check for any underlying eye condition which could be causing your light sensitivity. If you suddenly become sensitive to light or your light sensitive worsens, this should be checked as soon as possible, as it can indicate the worsening or development of a new condition. Much less commonly, sudden severe light sensitivity can be the first sign of a more serious condition such as meningitis, which can cause light to become painful very quickly. If you are in any doubt, it is always best to have any new symptoms checked by a doctor or optometrist. If the light sensitivity is a symptom of an underlying eye condition such as cataract, then treatment for your cataract can help to solve the glare problem. Treating eye conditions like uveitis often means that your eye becomes less light sensitive. Unfortunately, not all eye conditions can be treated. If your eye condition cannot be treated medically then there are still things that can help you cope with light sensitivity and glare."

        "source": "Macular hole",
        "summary": "A macular hole describes a small gap which develops in the macula at the centre of your retina.",
        "content": "A macular hole is a very different eye condition from macular degeneration, even though they both affect the macula. For this reason, they are treated differently to each other. This page contains a summary of our information on macular hole. To read our full information, download our factsheet: Often there is no known reason why someone develops a macular hole. They are more common between the ages of 60 and 80 and women experience them more often than men. It has been linked to: being slightly long-sighted (slight hyperopia) being very short-sighted (high myopia) having a severe eye injury having had a retinal detachment having long lasting macular swelling (cystoid macular oedema) your vitreous gel pulling on the macula (vitreomacular traction). If you develop a macular hole, you will probably notice changes in your central vision. These changes may range from only a slight worsening of central vision to a very noticeable decline, depending on the size and depth of your macular hole. As a macular hole develops, your vision will seem blurred and straight lines may look wavy and distorted, so that you have difficulty reading small print for example. You may even notice a small blank patch in the centre of your vision. If your ophthalmologist feels you need treatment for your macular hole, they will usually suggest an operation to treat it. Surgery aims to improve your vision by closing the macula hole. There are two main stages to the treatment: Surgery to remove the vitreous and insert a gas bubble into the eye. A recovery period when the gas bubble left inside your eye acts like a bandage, creating an environment that encourages your macular hole to close. In many cases, surgery can stop your blurred and distorted vision from getting worse and can help your sight to improve. For some people this can be to a high standard. In the months that follow surgery, 80-90 per cent of people have some degree of improvement in their vision, but this can depend on the size and age of the macular hole and what level of vision was present before surgery. If your macular hole is closed early enough, ideally within a few months of being diagnosed, your vision might improve by two or three lines of letters, sometimes more, on the sight test chart. There have even been some cases where treatment of more longstanding macular holes has led to visual improvement. As the outcome of treatment can vary from person to person, your ophthalmologist will be able to discuss with you how they hope you will benefit from surgery, depending on all aspects of your eye health and the stage of your macular hole. Whenever you have your surgery, even if your vision doesn\u2019t improve much, it\u2019s likely to stabilise and give you less distortion. For a minority of people, vision can worsen after surgery which may lead your ophthalmologist to suggest a second operation. They will be able to discuss with you how they hope you will benefit from surgery depending on the health of your eye and stage of your macular hole. It can take several months after surgery for the eye to fully recover and for someone to know just how much vision they have re-gained. Most of the eye recovery and vision improvement occurs within the first three months after surgery. In most cases, macular hole surgery has a high success rate, but a successful outcome will also depend on your individual circumstances and other aspects of your eye health. All surgery carries some risk of complications, and within macular hole surgery, if a complication develops, there are treatments available. For this reason, it is rare for someone to lose vision due to complications following macular hole surgery. However, your ophthalmologist will advise you on what the possible complications are and the chances of them happening to you. Complications from macular hole surgery include cataract, raised eye pressure, infection, retinal detachment and bleeding. Some people are advised to maintain a face-down position for a period following surgery. This is to improve the chances of a better outcome by keeping the floating gas bubble in contact with the macular hole for as long as possible. Although face-down positioning might improve the outcome for larger macular holes, most can be successfully repaired without the need for uncomfortable positioning. The length of time you\u2019re recommended to maintain a particular head position each day, and for how many days can also vary, but it is usually between three days and a week. Your ophthalmologist can discuss with you what they feel is best in your case and whether you need to position your head face down at all. There is more information about positioning face down (posturing) and how to prepare for it in our factsheet which you can download from the link at the top of this page. After surgery, you can usually go back to your general everyday activities once you have finished positioning face down. However, most people are advised not to return to work for at least a couple of weeks after surgery. Your ophthalmologist is best placed to advise you exactly how long to take off in your case. This will depend on the type of work you do and on how you recover. You may also need to avoid the following activities for the first few weeks, or as advised by your ophthalmologist, after surgery: Rubbing your eye. You may be asked to wear an eye patch or shield when you are sleeping to protect your eye. Swimming, to avoid infection from the water while your eye is healing. Strenuous exercise, contact sports and heavy lifting. Everyday lifting like light shopping is usually fine, but heavy lifting like moving furniture is best avoided. Wearing eye makeup, until the hospital is happy for you to do so. Flying or travelling to high altitude on land, until your gas bubble has fully absorbed, which can take up to 12 weeks. The gas bubble expands at high altitude, causing very high pressure in your eye which can cause permanent sight loss. It is unlikely that your vision will be good enough for you to safely drive while you have a gas bubble in your eye. While you are legally entitled to drive if the vision in your other eye is good enough to meet the driving standard, many ophthalmologists think that it\u2019s unwise to do so while the bubble remains in your eye. Ask your ophthalmologist for advice about driving after your surgery. You will usually see your ophthalmologist about two or three weeks after the operation to check that your macular hole is healing. At this appointment, you can ask about returning to all your usual activities, including your work, depending on how your eye is recovering. Most people will need to change their glasses at some point after their operation, usually when the gas bubble has completely gone about three months after surgery. Your ophthalmologist will be able to advise you as to when you can visit your optometrist (optician) for a new glasses\u2019 prescription. There is nothing you can do to avoid getting a macular hole and it doesn\u2019t develop because of anything you\u2019ve done. Diet and exercise haven\u2019t been found to make macular hole more likely. Having an eye examination at least every one to two years, as advised by your optometrist, is the best way to make sure your eyes are healthy and that no new eye conditions are developing. There is nothing you can do to fix a macular hole yourself and, in most cases, treatment is required as recommended by your ophthalmologist. Being diagnosed with an eye condition can be very upsetting. You may find that you are worried about the future and how you will manage with a change in your vision. All these feelings are natural. We\u2019re here to support you every step of the way, and to answer any questions you may have \u2013 just get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service. Many people who have macular hole surgery have some visual improvement afterwards in that eye. However, if your vision remains reduced after your surgery, there are lots of things you can do to make the most of the vision you still have. A low vision assessment can explore how to make the most of your sight. This may mean making things bigger, using brighter lighting, or using colour to make things easier to see. Your GP, optometrist or ophthalmologist can refer you to your local low vision service for an assessment. You can also find out tips for making the most of your sight by downloading our guide:"

        "summary": "Monocular vision is when an individual only has sight in one eye whether as the result of physically losing an eye or because of an eye condition.",
        "content": "If you have monocular vision or sight loss in one eye, we've put together some advice and answers to some commonly asked questions which we hope you'll find useful. It is perfectly normal to need some time to adjust to losing the sight in one of your eyes \u2013 both emotionally and practically. When you lose vision in one eye it\u2019s common to experience some uncomfortable symptoms as your visual system adjusts to this new way of seeing. You\u2019ll only be using one eye instead of using both eyes as a pair. This can initially cause some problems for people with things like depth perception (judging steps or correctly gauging how to pour liquid into a cup for example) and not having the field of vision on the affected side that you are used to (what you can see to the sides when looking straight ahead). If the sight loss is not complete, it may also cause things to appear less clear, as the poor sight in the affected eye can \"interfere\" with vision from the good eye. People can also find that their eyes can become tired sometimes after very little effort as the eyes are trying to work to make the best of the remaining vision. You can continue using your good eye for activities such as reading or watching television; it won\u2019t damage your eyes. However, you may find it helpful to take regular breaks from these tasks to prevent your eyes from becoming tired or fatigued. In the main, the solution to these problems is a natural adjustment which happens over time. Our brains are very adaptable and able to adjust to this change in vision. Usually, people find that with time their good eye \"takes over\" and that tasks that were previously difficult become easier. It\u2019s very difficult to say how long this adjustment will take as this is very individual. However, once someone has adjusted to monocular vision, they find that they are able to read, watch television and perform many day-to-day activities without any problems. Here are a few ideas that you may find useful to incorporate into things you do every day. When putting a drink down, place the other hand on the table or surface, then place the drink next to it. When pouring liquid, gently rest the lip of the container on the rim of the cup or glass. It can be difficult to judge the last step on the staircase. Move cautiously, feel ahead with your foot and keep a hand on the banister or handrail. You may find it useful when crossing the road, to stop at the kerb for a while to gauge the depth of the kerb and the distance of vehicles before crossing. Let friends and family know that it is easier for you if they walk or sit next to you on the side where you can see. In crowded areas, some people find that walking with a partner or against a wall on their affected side prevents them from bumping into other obstacles. You may find you have to turn your head more to see things towards your affected side. If you have monocular vision, you may still be able to drive a car or motorcycle if your other eye has good enough vision to meet the legal standards set by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), and you have adapted to the sight loss in one eye. Your ability to judge distances accurately may be affected and you may be less aware of objects on the side that has lost vision. Making better use of your wing mirrors will help. You will also need to bear in mind that blind spots caused by your car\u2019s design will be larger for you if you only have vision in one eye. For complete loss of vision in one eye (where there is no perception of light in the affected eye), the driver: must meet the same visual acuity and visual field standards as binocular drivers (drivers with sight in both eyes). This means that with your unaffected eye you must be able to read a number plate from 20 metres and read down to the 6/12 line (or better) on the eye test letter chart with any glasses or contact lenses you need. Your unaffected eye must also have good all-round field of vision. may drive only after clinical advice of successful adaptation to the condition. This means that you should not drive until you have been advised by your doctor or optometrist (optician) that you have fully adapted to monocular vision. Any driver with monocular vision must notify the DVLA if they fail to meet these requirements. If you live in Northern Ireland you must contact the Driver & Vehicle Agency (DVA). Your ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) or optometrist will be able to advise you further about these requirements and let you know whether you need to notify the DVLA or DVA. If you hold a Heavy Goods Vehicle or Public Service Vehicle licence, the rules and requirements are different, and you must let the DVLA or DVA know about your monocular vision. You will probably need to complete a V1V form from the DVLA. In Northern Ireland, contact the DVA. RNIB cannot give permission for you to carry on driving. If you have any doubt about whether you can meet the visual requirements for driving, your GP, optometrist, or ophthalmologist will be able to advise you. Many people who have sight in only one eye consider themselves partially sighted. However, an eye consultant will not be able to certify you as \u201cSight Impaired/Partially Sighted\u201d because you would not meet the criteria unless you also have a significant loss of sight in your other eye. This is because both eyes need to be affected by loss of vision in order to meet the criteria for certification. The criteria for certification and registration are set nationally by the Department of Health and applied at the discretion of a consultant ophthalmologist. If you have some loss of sight in your other eye as well then it is worth discussing the possibility of registration with your ophthalmologist. It\u2019s important for people who have good sight in only one eye to have regular eye examinations with an optometrist so that the health of the eye they rely on can be monitored. Your optometrist should let you know how often you need to have your eyes examined. For people who have sight in only one eye, it may be a good idea to consider the use of protective eyewear or sports goggles for certain sports or activities, such as gardening or DIY, to prevent injury to the good eye. You can speak to a dispensing optician at your local optician practice for more advice about this. Dispensing opticians are qualified in the dispensing and fitting of eyewear and can give professional advice about suitable protective frames and lenses. If you have further questions about monocular vision, please get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service by calling 0303 123 9999. Artificial Eyes provides some useful information on adapting to monocular vision which may be helpful for people who have lost sight in one eye."

        "summary": "Myopia, also known as \u201cbeing short sighted\u201d, causes your vision to be blurry in the distance but clearer when looking at things up close.",
        "content": "Myopia is a very common focusing problem, and for most people it can be easily corrected using glasses or contact lenses to make vision clear and crisp. Most people with myopia have healthy eyes. Pathological myopia is different from simply being short sighted. Pathological myopia means that you are very short sighted and that this has caused degenerative changes to the back of your eye. Pathological myopia can cause a reduction in your sight that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. This page contains a summary of our information on myopia and pathological myopia. To read our full information, download our factsheet: For vision to be clear, light entering your eye needs to be focused accurately on your retina. Light entering your eye is first focused by the cornea and then finely focused by the lens. Ideally, when light enters your eye, this focusing system should makes sure that when light enters your eye, it is sharply in focus as it reaches the retina. This will mean that you see everything in focus without any blurriness. However, if someone has a focusing or \u201crefractive\u201d error, light is not focused correctly onto the back of the eye and vision is not clear. In people with myopia, the light entering the eye comes to a focus point before it reaches your retina. This makes vision blurry and is caused by the eyeball being too long or the cornea (the clear window at the front of the eye) being more steeply curved. People with myopia require a prescription for glasses or contact lenses with a minus lens power to correct their vision. This lens reduces the excessive bending of light by the eye, thereby focusing it onto the retina rather than infront of it, to produce a sharp clear image. Optometrists (also known as opticians) measure the focusing power of your eye in dioptres. This is a technical term for how strong a lens would have to be to correct the focusing of your eye and give you clear vision. Myopia is written with a minus power on your glasses or contact lens prescription; for example, a prescription for three and a half dioptres of myopia would be written: -3.50 dioptres (D). The minus sign indicates that the lens is correcting for myopia. The higher the number, the more short sighted you are. Mild myopia includes powers up to -3.00 dioptres (D). Moderate myopia, a power of -3.00D to -6.00D. High myopia is usually a power over -6.00D. Most people with myopia of less than -6.00D don\u2019t develop any further problems. This is sometimes known as simple myopia, meaning that your eyes are healthy and that the blurriness that your myopia causes is easily corrected for with glasses or contact lenses. If you have myopia higher than -6.00D, you may be at greater risk of developing the following eye conditions: posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) retinal detachment glaucoma cataracts. However, not everyone with myopia above -6.00D will develop other eye conditions, and for most people their eyes will be healthy. If you\u2019ve been diagnosed with pathological or degenerative myopia, you have very high myopia, and your eye also shows degenerative changes affecting the back of the eye (the retina). Retinal atrophy \u2013 these are areas where your retina has become very thin and is no longer working. Lattice degeneration \u2013 a type of retinal thinning at the far edges of your retina. Lacquer cracks \u2013 breaks that occur in the membrane (Bruch\u2019s membrane) between the retina and its underlying blood supply (the choroid layer). New blood vessels (myopic choroidal neovascularisation) \u2013 new leaky blood vessels can grow from the blood supply underneath the retina (from the choroid layer), through lacquer cracks or areas of atrophy onto the retina. Myopic macular degeneration \u2013 these degenerative changes can develop at the macula (the central part of the retina). Myopic macular degeneration is also known as myopic maculopathy and can affect your central detailed vision. Foster Fuchs spot \u2013 myopic choroidal neovascularisation can lead to scarring at the macula, known as a Foster Fuchs spot. This scarring can cause a blank or missing patch in your central vision. The type of treatment you may need will depend upon the degenerative change that has developed. Unfortunately, not all the changes that happen in pathological myopia, such as retinal atrophy and lacquer cracks, can be treated. If you start to develop new blood vessels at the macula, this can be treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment. Anti-VEGF medications work by reducing the growth of new, leaky blood vessels and the oedema (swelling) they may cause. This treatment can reduce the risk of scarring and damage to the retina caused by these new vessels, which in turn can help to avoid further deterioration in sight. If you already have high myopia, there are no treatments available to stop your eye from developing the complications of high or pathological myopia. This is because it\u2019s not possible to control the growth of your eye. There\u2019s currently no evidence to suggest that diet, vitamins, or supplements can affect your chances of developing pathological myopia or make it worse. Currently treatment is aimed at improving your vision and to treat any complications if they happen. You will be monitored regularly by your optometrist or ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) who will check the health of your eyes. It\u2019s important to have your eyes checked by your optometrist or ophthalmologist as soon as possible if you notice any changes to your vision or any new symptoms. Most people who have myopia don\u2019t have any complications and will only ever need glasses or contact lenses to make their vision sharper. If your prescription is over -10.00D, then you would be entitled to a NHS complex lens voucher to use towards the cost of your glasses or contact lenses. Your optician would be able to tell you how much this voucher is worth and if your prescription would entitle you to a NHS complex lens voucher. The higher your level of myopia is, the higher the risk of developing eye conditions associated with myopia and pathological myopia. If your retina has been damaged, then your vision may need more than glasses to help you see well. A low vision assessment can explore how to make the most of your sight. This may mean making things bigger, using brighter lighting, or using colour to make things easier to see. Your GP, optometrist or ophthalmologist can refer you to your local low vision service for an assessment. You can also find out tips for making the most of your sight by downloading our guide: Many people with pathological myopia find that they are sensitive to light, known as photophobia. You may find bright light uncomfortable, or you find it difficult to adapt to changing levels of lighting. Using sunglasses, tinted lenses and sunshields can all help to reduce the discomfort and glare you may experience in everyday living. Find more information about light sensitivity. If you have pathological myopia or an eye condition caused by high myopia, you may have sight problems which cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. If this is the case, you are required by law to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) if the changes are affecting both your eyes. You may be able to continue driving if your sight meets the DVLA visual standards. Your optometrist or ophthalmologist will be able to tell you if your vision meets the DVLA standard or if you need to tell the DVLA about your sight problems."

        "content": "If you live in the UK and have been diagnosed with nystagmus, we would like your views about our information on nystagmus. Your views will help us make our information as useful as possible for other people diagnosed with this condition. We would like to hear from you if you are happy to: Read our information on nystagmus (download the factsheets in either PDF and Word format below). Answer a few questions over the phone or by email about how helpful the current content is, based on your experience of the condition, and how our information could be improved. To find out more please contact the RNIB Eye Health Information team on 020 7391 3299 or email [email\u00a0protected]. This can be in a side to side, an up and down, or a circular motion, or a combination of these. This uncontrolled movement can affect how clearly you can see. Most people with nystagmus have reduced vision. Nystagmus is caused by a problem with the way the eye sends messages back to the brain or how parts of the brain which deal with eye movement make sense of the information. This page contains a summary of our information on nystagmus. To read our full information, download our Understanding Nystagmus guide, which is accredited by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists: There are two main types of nystagmus: infantile or congenital nystagmus which appears in the first few months of life, and acquired nystagmus, which develops later in life. Infantile or congenital nystagmus is also sometimes known as \u201cearly onset nystagmus\u201d or \u201cinfantile nystagmus syndrome\u201d (INS). It is usually diagnosed in very young children, soon after they\u2019re born or sometimes in the first few months of their life. This type of nystagmus can be associated with a problem with the eyes themselves or with a problem with the parts of the brain which control eye movements. But sometimes children develop nystagmus without any of these problems. Some eye conditions which a baby is born with can be associated with nystagmus, including: congenital cataracts ocular albinism retinal dystrophies, such as cone dystrophy, congenital stationary night blindness, or Leber congenital amaurosis optic nerve conditions, such as optic nerve coloboma or hypoplasia aniridia. However, many children with nystagmus don\u2019t have any problem with their eye, brain or health. When a cause for the nystagmus can\u2019t be found, it is called \u201cidiopathic infantile nystagmus\u201d or \u201cidiopathic nystagmus syndrome\u201d. Some of these children may have a faulty gene known to cause nystagmus. Nystagmus that develops later, mostly in adults, is called \u201cacquired nystagmus\u201d. Anything that damages the parts of the brain that control eye movements can result in acquired nystagmus. Acquired nystagmus is usually a sign of another underlying condition such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, brain tumour, head injury or the effects of a drug. If you have nystagmus, your eyes are always moving, although it may not always be obvious to you or others. The way that nystagmus affects vision varies from person to person; however, it doesn\u2019t lead to total loss of sight. How your vision is affected if you have infantile nystagmus varies a lot and can often depend on the underlying cause of your nystagmus. Some people may be able to read most sizes of print without help, while others may have a significantly reduced level of vision. Most people with nystagmus have some useful vision and normally nystagmus doesn\u2019t get worse with age. Your vision can vary in quality when you have nystagmus, depending on which direction you\u2019re looking in or whether you\u2019re looking at something far away or close. Your vision can also vary depending on how you\u2019re feeling. The more stressful or tiring you find a situation, the worse your vision can become. Your vision may also become worse when you\u2019re feeling unwell, or if you\u2019re anxious or upset. Having nystagmus may mean that you need longer to see or read things. The constant movement of your eyes means that you have less time to focus on what is in front of you, for example printed text. The effects of nystagmus may improve when your head is held in a particular position, which can help you to see things better. This is known as the \u201cnull zone\u201d. This is often the direction of your gaze where your eye movements are slowest and most stable. Slowing or making eye movements more stable may mean your vision becomes clearer. Children with infantile nystagmus often find their null zone naturally. Parents or teachers may notice that a child tilts their head to one side, or looks at things sideways. Some people with nystagmus also find that nodding their head helps to improve their vision. People with nystagmus may find they have poor depth perception and so may find it difficult to judge distances and height. If you develop nystagmus later in life, you may experience a constant awareness of the world moving around you, or in front of you. This is known as oscillopsia. As the nystagmus is new, your brain has not adapted to the unexpected eye movements and so it sees the world moving. This is very disabling and can make things very difficult to see, as well as sometimes making you feel sick and dizzy. Depending on what has caused your acquired nystagmus, it may be a short-term condition that might get better. However, some people have the condition for the long term which can cause problems with how well they can see as well as being disorientating. There is currently no cure for nystagmus. Having nystagmus can cause reduced vision but there are things which can help manage the condition and make the most of your sight. Glasses and contact lenses will ensure that you, or your child, have the best vision possible. They can\u2019t correct nystagmus but can correct for any refractive error you may have. In young children with infantile nystagmus, treatment with glasses is important to help their vision develop as fully as possible. A low vision assessment will look at ways to help people make the most of their vision. This may mean making things bigger, using brighter lighting, or using colour or contrast to make things easier to see. The assessment gives people a chance to discuss any practical problems they are having with their vision with a low vision specialist. The specialist can explore things like magnifiers, lighting, colour contrast and other adaptations that may help, such as tinted glasses which may be useful to control glare. There are also some other options which can sometimes help to manage nystagmus. These options don\u2019t work for everyone as their suitability varies from person to person. The options are: Surgery can be used to change the position of the muscles that move the eye. The surgery can\u2019t correct the nystagmus but can be helpful in reducing the amount a person needs to turn their head to get to their null zone, making it more comfortable to keep their head in the best position. It doesn\u2019t work for everyone and it usually isn\u2019t considered until a child is older and when the null zone is more stable. Medication and drugs may be used in some specific cases of acquired nystagmus, for example if the nystagmus is caused by multiple sclerosis. Drugs can sometimes help control eye movements and reduce the symptoms of oscillopsia. However, for many people the side effects of these drugs may outweigh the benefit they get. Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections into the eye muscles may occasionally be used to help some people who have acquired nystagmus that is caused by a neurological problem, such as multiple sclerosis. Botox weakens the eye muscles and helps to slow down the movements. The effects are only temporary but can sometimes help to reduce the symptoms of oscillopsia in the short term. However, Botox can weaken all eye movements and not just the eye movements relating to the nystagmus, so this can cause its own problems which limits the usefulness of this treatment. You may hear of research into other management therapies such as acupuncture or biofeedback, which aims to reduce nystagmus through audio signals. However, it\u2019s uncertain whether any of these therapies work and more research is needed. It can seem overwhelming at first if you or your child have just been diagnosed with nystagmus. Although nystagmus can cause problems with your sight, with the right support at the right time, most people can lead full and independent lives. We\u2019re here to support you every step of the way, and to answer any questions you may have \u2013 just get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service. You might also find the information on our children, young people and families pages helpful. For children with infantile nystagmus, having the right support at school can make a big difference. When a child is first diagnosed with an eye condition, a qualified teacher for visual impairment (QTVI) can provide support with development, play, learning and education. This support is continued from infancy into school and higher education, and other support is available when moving into employment. At an early stage, ask your local authority to put you in contact with a QTVI. They will support you and your child as soon as a visual impairment is suspected or diagnosed. If you have difficulty getting help or need the details of the specialist teacher in your area, contact our Helpline. Depending on how much of a person\u2019s sight is affected by nystagmus, they may be eligible to be registered as sight impaired (partially sighted) or severely sight impaired (blind). Registration can act as a passport to expert help and sometimes to financial concessions. A low vision assessment can explore how to make the most of your sight. This may mean making things bigger, using brighter lighting or using colour to make things easier to see.

Optic neuritis usually causes a reduction or loss of vision in at least one eye, so that your vision becomes very blurred, dim, or faded. This reduction in vision usually comes on over the course of a few days and may continue to worsen over the first two weeks. Optic neuritis usually affects vision in one eye, but in some types, it may affect both eyes. Optic neuritis commonly affects the central area of your vision, causing it to become blurry and unclear. However, any area of your vision (your visual field) may be affected. Central vision is the sight which you use for reading, watching television, using a computer as well as recognising people's faces and doing close tasks that require detailed vision. Some people with optic neuritis describe seeing flashing or flickering lights. You may also find that your colour vision is affected. Colours, particularly reds, can appear \u201cwashed out\u201d or less bright than usual. In addition, you may notice that you are less able to pick out objects against their backgrounds, particularly if they are a similar shade or colour, for example reading yellow text on a yellow background. This is described as having reduced contrast sensitivity. Your vision in the affected eye may also temporarily worsen due to heat, for example after a bath, or if you exercise, although this should improve again once you cool down. When your vision is first affected it\u2019s common to experience discomfort or pain around your eyes, which might get worse when you move your eyes. This pain may be present before the change in your vision, or it may happen at the same time. It will normally only last a few days. The most common type of optic neuritis is \u201cdemyelinating\u201d optic neuritis. In most people, the cause of demyelinating optic neuritis is not known. This is often called \u201cidiopathic\u201d, meaning that no cause for the inflammation can be found. Some cases may be \u201cautoimmune\u201d, where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, causing inflammation. Certain autoimmune conditions can be associated with optic neuritis including multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica (NMO), and sarcoidosis. Less commonly, optic neuritis can also be caused by infection (infectious optic neuritis), or as a reaction to how your body's immune system copes with an infection (parainfectious optic neuritis). The most common type of optic neuritis is demyelinating optic neuritis. Demyelination is where the protective myelin coating on your nerve fibres breaks down. When your myelin breaks down patches of demyelination, known as lesions, occur. These can slow down or stop the signal being carried by the nerve to your brain. This can then affect your vision. The reasons why demyelination happens are not clearly understood, but evidence suggests that the body\u2019s own immune system causes the myelin to break down (autoimmune). There is an association between demyelinating optic neuritis and MS. MS is a demyelinating condition that can affect any part of the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS includes the brain and spinal cord and is responsible for controlling all the functions in our bodies such as balance, movement, emotions, as well as vision. MS can cause a large range of symptoms depending on which part of the CNS has been affected, and these can vary widely from person to person. If you are diagnosed with demyelinating optic neuritis, your ophthalmologist may discuss the possibility that this could be linked to MS. There is evidence that people who have an acute episode of demyelinating optic neuritis have a 38 per cent risk of going on to develop MS within 10 years. However, it is important to remember that not everyone who has acute demyelinating optic neuritis will be diagnosed with MS or will develop MS in the future. For many people with optic neuritis, vision typically gets worse over a period of several days to two weeks and then begins to improve. Optic neuritis usually gets better on its own. A large-scale study, the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT), looked at the best way to treat optic neuritis in nearly 400 people. This trial found that regardless of whether treatment was given or not, over 90 percent of the people they followed for the study had an improvement in their sight within the first month from when vision loss began. If you are experiencing discomfort or pain because of optic neuritis and this is very uncomfortable, your GP or ophthalmologist should be able to advise you about pain relief. It may be possible to improve things with over-the-counter pain medications. This pain or discomfort should normally only last for a few days. With time, most people with optic neuritis will make a good visual recovery and will not require any treatment. However, in some situations, treatment may be felt to be helpful. If needed, treatment for optic neuritis is a combination of high dose intravenous (via a drip) followed by oral (tablet) steroids. Intravenous steroids are usually given for three days, for which you would need to be admitted to hospital. Steroids are then given as tablets for another eleven days and the dosage is slowly reduced on the last three days. If your vision is quite severely affected, this steroid treatment may speed up recovery by a week or so, however studies have found that this treatment makes no difference to how well your vision recovers in the long term. Therefore, the small benefit from this treatment would need to be weighed against the risks and side effects of taking high dose steroids. This means that most people with optic neuritis will not have steroid treatment. Steroid treatment may occasionally be given if someone has poor vision in the other eye, if the symptoms are particularly severe or distressing, or if the change in vision impacts on activities which may be essential for someone's job, for example, driving. If you have an underlying autoimmune condition causing your optic neuritis, then this may also be treated with steroids or immunosuppressant medication. If your optic neuritis is caused by an underlying infection, then you may need treatment with antimicrobial medication. Your ophthalmologist would be able to discuss what course of action would be best for you. The initial improvement in vision happens as inflammation goes down and your optic nerve begins to recover. Recovery of your vision can happen quickly at first but may then slow down. Your vision may continue to improve over a period of six months to a year and by about nine to twelve months it\u2019s likely to be clear what the final recovery of your vision is. It may be difficult to predict what your vision will be like in the long term. If this is the first time you have had optic neuritis, your sight should make a good recovery, even if your vision is quite severely affected to start with. About 75 percent of people diagnosed with the most common type of optic neuritis, acute demyelinating optic neuritis, will make a very good long term visual recovery. Following an episode of optic neuritis, the ophthalmologist or optometrist may be able to see some lasting damage to the optic nerve when they examine the back of your eye. This lasting damage is known as \u201coptic atrophy\u201d. For some people this might mean that after an initial improvement they can still be left with some permanent visual changes. These can include colours appearing faded and reduced contrast sensitivity. You may also notice that your vision isn't as sharp as it used to be and/or that you struggle with your perception of depth or movement. These symptoms can be present even if your central vision is good on the letter chart when tested by your ophthalmologist or optometrist. More rarely, some people may not experience a great deal of improvement in vision and be left with reduced vision even after the inflammation has settled. If you have had optic neuritis once, there is some risk that it may occur again in either eye. The ONTT found that 28 per cent of people who had optic neuritis, had another episode within five years, and this went up to 35 percent of people within 10 years. However, this does mean that 65 per cent of people (more than half) had not experienced any further episodes of optic neuritis within 10 years. It may not be possible to predict whether you will experience further episodes of optic neuritis. However, you may wish to explore this with your ophthalmologist, as they may be able to give you more information based on your medical history and whether this is the first time you have had optic neuritis. Most people with optic neuritis make a good recovery of their vision and may not have any long-term problems with their sight. A few people may be left with some permanent changes to their sight, but much can be done to help you make the most of your remaining vision and adapt to any changes. If both your eyes have been affected, or if the affected eye was your good eye and you have a sight problem in your other eye, then you may need to make changes or use aids to make the most of your remaining sight. This may mean making things bigger, using brighter lighting, or using colour to make things easier to see. You should ask your ophthalmologist, optometrist or GP about low vision aids and getting a low vision assessment. During this assessment with an optometrist, you\u2019ll be able to discuss the use of magnifiers and aids to help you to see things more clearly.

        "summary": "Light sensitivity or \u201cphotophobia\u201d is common in people diagnosed with eye conditions or sight loss.",
        "content": "Light sensitivity is where the light level in the environment is too bright and causes discomfort. For some people, this discomfort can be extreme and can further reduce their usable vision. This page contains a summary of our information on light sensitivity. Our downloadable factsheet has our full information on light sensitivity caused by eye conditions, but the ideas may also help people without any eye conditions: Glare is where bright or reflected light can affect our ability to see or is uncomfortable to look at. Many people with low vision need more light than usual to read. However, too much or the wrong sort of light can cause problems with glare. There are two types of glare - discomfort glare and disability glare. Discomfort glare occurs when a light source is just too strong for our eyes. It may cause us to \u201cscrew up\u201d or shade our eyes; it can even cause us to close our eyes. It makes us want to look away from the light source, because it is uncomfortable to look at, but it doesn\u2019t cause a reduction in vision. Disability glare reduces how well we can see. Disability glare can be caused by eye conditions and can occur with ordinary light sources and levels of light. Disability glare doesn\u2019t necessarily cause discomfort but can reduce how much detail we can see. This type of glare generally reduces contrast, making it difficult to distinguish objects. Many eye conditions can cause light sensitivity and glare, some examples include: Ocular albinism \u2013 this is when some people are born with a lack of pigment in the eye. Aniridia \u2013 a condition where the iris is missing from birth. Cataracts \u2013 clouding of the lens inside the eye. Macular degeneration \u2013 a condition affecting the macula, the area in the eye responsible for our central, detailed vision. Uveitis \u2013 inflammation inside the eye, such as iritis. Inherited retinal dystrophies such as retinitis pigmentosa. Conditions which affect the front surface of the eye such as conjunctivitis, dry eye or corneal problems. If you start to experience light sensitivity, it\u2019s important to see an optometrist (also known as an optician) to have your eyes checked. An optometrist will be able to examine the health of your eyes to check for any underlying eye condition which could be causing your light sensitivity. If you suddenly become sensitive to light or your light sensitive worsens, this should be checked as soon as possible, as it can indicate the worsening or development of a new condition. Much less commonly, sudden severe light sensitivity can be the first sign of a more serious condition such as meningitis, which can cause light to become painful very quickly. If you are in any doubt, it is always best to have any new symptoms checked by a doctor or optometrist. If the light sensitivity is a symptom of an underlying eye condition such as cataract, then treatment for your cataract can help to solve the glare problem. Treating eye conditions like uveitis often means that your eye becomes less light sensitive. Unfortunately, not all eye conditions can be treated. If your eye condition cannot be treated medically then there are still things that can help you cope with light sensitivity and glare."

        "source": "Posterior capsule opacification",
        "summary": "Posterior capsule opacification (PCO) is a complication that can occur some time after cataract surgery.",
        "content": "PCO can cause vision to become cloudy again and can even make it seem as though your cataract has returned, with symptoms of hazy vision or glare from lights. PCO can be easily treated with a quick, painless, outpatient laser procedure known as YAG (Yttrium Aluminium Garnet) laser surgery, to make vision clear again. Once you have had the YAG laser treatment, PCO doesn\u2019t normally cause any long-term problems with your sight. A cataract is a clouding of the lens in your eye and normally occurs as part of the ageing process, although there are other reasons why a cataract can develop earlier in life, such as medications you may have taken, other eye or health conditions, or trauma to the eye. During cataract surgery the natural lens of your eye, which has become cloudy, is replaced by a clear artificial lens also known as an intraocular lens implant or IOL. This new artificial lens is placed inside your lens capsule, the membrane that originally covered your natural lens. Your lens capsule is clear and should remain clear following your cataract surgery. PCO occurs because cells remaining after cataract surgery grow over the back (posterior) of the capsule causing it to thicken and become slightly opaque (cloudy). This means that light is less able to travel clearly through to the retina at the back of your eye. As a result, your sight can become blurred and cloudy, or you may have problems with bright lights and glare. The effects of PCO on your sight are very similar to the changes you may have had when your cataract first started to cause you problems. If you have had cataract surgery in both eyes, PCO can affect both eyes, but each eye may be affected at different times. Although PCO is quite common, there are some reasons why you may be more likely to develop it. If you have other pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes related eye conditions, glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa or have very short sight (high myopia), you are more likely to develop PCO. The younger you are when you have cataract surgery, the more likely it is that this thickening will occur. PCO is also more common in people who have had a complication during or after their actual cataract surgery, such as where inflammation (swelling) is present in your eye. However, it\u2019s not unusual to develop PCO even if you don\u2019t have these conditions. PCO is treated by a very low risk, quick, painless laser treatment. It is carried out in the outpatient clinic. If you have PCO in both eyes, then it is possible to have treatment for both on the same day. At the appointment you will be given some eye drops to dilate (widen) your pupil. These can make your vision blurrier. Sometimes, but not always, the ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) may use a contact lens to help to keep your eye in the right position and help with focusing the laser. If this is needed, then you will also be given eye drops to anaesthetise (numb) the front of your eye so that you do not feel any discomfort, although you will be aware that the contact lens is touching the eye. Once your pupil is dilated, you will be asked to sit and place your head on the headrest of the laser machine. This will help to keep your head and eye still, which is necessary, while the ophthalmologist uses the laser to remove part of the capsule. There may also be a nurse present while the treatment takes place. The ophthalmologist focuses the laser exactly onto the back of the lens capsule to cut away a small circle-shaped area to allow light to pass without obstruction. This leaves some of the capsule behind to keep your artificial lens in place (like a cuff around the IOL) but removes enough in the middle to allow the light to pass directly through to the retina. The laser uses a wavelength of light that cannot be seen, but you may notice a red light, which helps the ophthalmologist focus the laser beam. Each laser pulse is over in a fraction of a second and you will not feel any pain or discomfort. You may notice a few flashing lights or hear some faint clicks coming from the machine as the laser works. The procedure does not take very long; normally it will take about 5-10 minutes. The laser treatment is considered very safe. All procedures carry some aspect of risk, but serious side effects from laser treatment for PCO are very rare. Laser treatment for PCO is carried out using a very low energy laser called \u201cNd: YAG laser\u201d, sometimes referred to as just \u201cYAG\u201d. The Nd: YAG laser is just a special sort of light that can delicately cut the lens capsule without any risk of damage to other parts of your eye. Sometimes, if a contact lens was used to steady your eye during the treatment, your eye may be a little sore afterwards, but this should soon wear off. For some people, laser treatment for PCO can cause eye pressure to rise. This can be an issue if you already have a pre-existing eye condition such as glaucoma, as your eye pressure may already be higher than normal. If your ophthalmologist is concerned about this, they will check your eye pressure soon after the laser treatment. If your eye pressure has increased, you will be given some eye drops or a tablet to bring it back down. Rarely, laser can cause a retinal detachment which can happen days, weeks, months or years after the treatment. This is more likely to happen if you are very short sighted. If it does occur, retinal detachment can be treated with surgery to re-attach the retina. It\u2019s important to have your eyes checked immediately if you experience the following symptoms, as these may be a sign of a retinal detachment: a sudden onset of new floaters (other than those immediately after laser treatment) flashing lights a dark curtain moving up, down or across your vision. Retinal detachment can be treated with surgery to re-attach the retina, but this needs to be done quickly, which is why it\u2019s important to have your eyes checked immediately if you notice these symptoms. Having your eyes examined on the same day or within 24 hours of the start of new or worsening symptoms means that your ophthalmologist or optometrist (optician) can look for any signs of retinal tear or detachment. It is important to stress that these risks are rare complications of the laser treatment. Most people get an excellent and permanent improvement in their vision following laser without experiencing any issues. It may take a few days for your sight to become clear again, and you may notice \u201cfloaters\u201d after your laser treatment. Floaters are harmless clumps of cells which move around inside the vitreous (a clear jelly-like substance which fills the inside of the eye). You may see floaters as dots, circles, lines, clouds, or cobwebs. Over time these will settle down and become less noticeable. Because the laser treatment does not require any incisions or stitches, you are normally able to return to your daily activities straight away. However, immediately after treatment, your pupils will still be dilated so your vision may be blurred for a few hours afterwards. You will need to avoid driving until this blurriness has gone. You should not drive yourself home after the treatment as it can take some time for the drops that dilate your pupils to wear off, and your vision may still be blurry following the laser treatment. You should arrange to get home by public transport or arrange for someone else to drive you home following your treatment. After laser treatment for PCO, your sight should go back to the way it was following your original cataract surgery, provided no other problems have developed in your eye. You will still have to use any glasses you used before the PCO developed, but your vision should be clear again with these, unless you have any other eye conditions affecting your sight. Your optometrist may have advised against updating your glasses prescription at your last eye examination, because they were referring you for YAG laser for PCO. If this is the case, it may be necessary for you to return to your optometrist to have your glasses prescription rechecked, before any new glasses are made up. However, the spectacles prescribed after a cataract operation and before the PCO would normally be quite adequate again after the YAG treatment. You will generally only need to have laser treatment for PCO once. Very rarely, certain cells may develop in the area of the posterior capsule, or the opening in the capsule made by the first laser treatment can shrink, causing PCO to come back. If this does happen it is possible to safely have further laser treatment if needed. PCO can cause your vision to become blurry and you may have glare or difficulties in bright light before you have the laser treatment. You may also find reading difficult. There are a lot of things you can do to make the most of your vision if you are having any difficulties while you wait for treatment. This may mean making things bigger, using brighter lighting, or using colour to make things easier to see. Find out more about how to make the most of your sight by downloading our guide:"

To find out more please contact the RNIB Eye Health Information team on 020 7391 3299 or email [email\u00a0protected]. This is caused by changes in your vitreous gel. PVD isn\u2019t painful and it doesn\u2019t cause sight loss, but you may have symptoms such as seeing floaters (small dark spots or shapes) and flashing lights. These symptoms will calm down as your brain learns to ignore them. With time, you should be able to see just as well as you could before your PVD started. The symptoms of PVD are very similar to those of a different eye condition called retinal detachment, which needs prompt treatment to stop you losing part or all of the sight in your eye. Because of this, it\u2019s important to have your eyes examined by an ophthalmologist (also known as a hospital eye doctor) or an optometrist (also known as an optician) within 24 hours of noticing any symptoms so that an accurate diagnosis can be made. You can do this by visiting your optometrist or attending A&E or eye casualty. About 10 to 15 per cent of people with PVD develop a retinal tear, which, if left untreated will develop into a retinal detachment. A retinal tear or detachment can be successfully treated if diagnosed early. Most people diagnosed with PVD will not develop a retinal tear or detachment. This page contains a summary of our information on PVD. To read our full information, download our Understanding Posterior Vitreous Detachment guide, which is accredited by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists: Your eye is filled with a clear gel called the vitreous. The vitreous helps to keep your eye\u2019s shape. It is made up mainly of water and a protein called collagen. As you age, it is common for the vitreous to become more watery and less like a gel. When the vitreous gets too soft, it loses its shape, and comes away from the retina and shrinks in towards the centre of your eye. This is not a problem as we do not need the vitreous attached to the retina to see well. PVD is a natural change in the eye and is not a sign of another eye health problem. Most people with PVD are over the age of 50 but you can have a PVD in your 40s, particularly if you\u2019re short-sighted or if your eye has been injured or you\u2019ve had previous eye surgery. PVD can cause several symptoms: Floaters for the first time or more floaters than you had before. The new floaters are usually noticed suddenly. There may be lots of new floaters or commonly a large cobweb-like floater. Flashes of light in your vision, usually like brief streaks of light in your side (peripheral) vision. Blurred vision. As the process of a PVD can last some weeks to some months, your symptoms may be ongoing for this period. Generally, your floaters and the flashes of light will gradually calm down and become less obvious to you. You might be aware of your floaters in the long-term following a PVD, although they are generally not as noticeable as when they first began. If the symptoms are not worsening after your eyes have been checked and PVD is diagnosed, then they are not usually a cause for concern. If you\u2019re worried about any symptoms that don\u2019t go away, speak to your optometrist or ophthalmologist about it. Floaters are very common and many people have them, even if they don\u2019t have PVD. They\u2019re floating clumps of cells that form in your vitreous. You can see them because they cast shadows on your retina when light comes into your eye. These floaters do not harm your eye. Floaters can be different shapes and sizes \u2013 dots that can look like flies, threads, circles, clouds, spiders or cobwebs. You may notice that your floaters move around a lot, or they may not seem to move much at all. They tend to be more obvious on a sunny day or when looking at a bright computer screen or a white or lightly coloured background. You may only have a few floaters or you may have many of them. Floaters may appear quite suddenly, and they may be very frustrating or worrying to you. When they\u2019re at their most intense, you might think that your floaters will always interfere with your vision, but for most people, they become less obvious over time. Floaters never leave the eye but become less noticeable as the vitreous settles down and your brain learns to ignore them. When your vitreous pulls away from your retina, your retina reacts to this stimulation by sending a signal to your brain. Your brain processes this signal as a small, short flash of light, which you\u2019ll often see more in the dark or dim lighting. These flashes of light won\u2019t affect you for as long as floaters, and they will probably become a lot less frequent once the vitreous has fully come away from your retina. If you have a large floater, moving your eyes gently round in circles may help. This moves the vitreous inside your eyes and can sometimes move the floater out of your direct line of vision so you\u2019re less aware of it. If your optometrist has advised you to wear glasses, wearing these when you need to will help you to see what you\u2019re doing more easily. When your vision is clearer, you\u2019re more likely to be able to concentrate on the task, rather than on the floaters. Wearing sunglasses in bright conditions will make your floaters less noticeable. The tinted lenses reduce the amount of light entering your eyes, which means that your floaters cast a fainter shadow on your retina. If your floaters are distracting you when you\u2019re using a computer or tablet, reducing the brightness of the screen may make them less noticeable. There isn\u2019t any medical treatment for PVD and there\u2019s no evidence that eye exercises, diet changes or vitamins can help. Given that the symptoms of PVD improve over time and that the vitreous does not need to be attached to the retina to see well, treatment for PVD is not needed. You may have heard that it\u2019s possible to treat PVD either with a laser or with surgery to remove the vitreous from your eye. Very few ophthalmologists offer laser treatment for floaters, and in the UK it\u2019s not a routine treatment. It\u2019s very unlikely to be funded by the NHS so you\u2019d usually have to pay for this privately. The laser may make large floaters smaller but it\u2019s still not clear whether it\u2019s safe or makes your vision any better. If you\u2019re considering laser treatment, make sure you ask about the risks beforehand. There is surgery called a vitrectomy where your vitreous is removed from your eye. Although this can reduce your floaters, it\u2019s a major operation and there are risks from having this surgery. Because of this, it\u2019s not usually offered to people with PVD in the UK. In most people with PVD, the vitreous comes away gently from the retina without any problems and does not cause any long-term changes to your sight. A very small number of people may experience complications from their PVD. In a small number of people, PVD can lead to a retinal tear. This is because the vitreous may be more firmly attached in certain places to the retina. As your vitreous moves away from your retina in PVD, it can pull on your retina, causing it to tear. The risk of this happening tends to be highest when the symptoms of PVD first begin. Once the vitreous has fully detached from the retina, the risk of developing a tear from PVD goes back down. Retinal tears can be successfully treated to prevent them from developing into a retinal detachment which can cause sight loss, but they do need to be treated promptly. Retinal tears from PVD are much rarer than PVD alone and only 10-15 per cent of people have a retinal tear following PVD. An even smaller number go on to develop a retinal detachment. If someone does develop a retinal tear from a PVD, it tends to occur when the PVD symptoms first begin or if the symptoms noticeably increase. Having your eyes examined on the same day or within 24 hours of the start of new or worsening symptoms means that your ophthalmologist or optometrist can look for any signs of retinal tear or detachment. It\u2019s important to remember that most people who have PVD do not develop any complications. Most people with a PVD can carry on with their normal day-to-day activities with no restrictions. Some ophthalmologists advise that high impact exercise should be avoided during the first six weeks after the start of a PVD. This is because your vitreous may not have completely detached from your retina and you may be at greater risk of having a retinal detachment during this time. There is no evidence either way that any of the following activities will cause any problems with your PVD, but some people may be advised to or choose to avoid: Very heavy lifting, energetic or high impact exercises, such as running or aerobics. Playing contact sports, such as rugby, martial arts, or boxing. Inverted positions in activities such as yoga or Pilates. You should always ask your ophthalmologist for advice about what activities you should avoid doing and for how long as the advice given may depend on whether they feel your retina may be particularly at risk. If you do participate in any activities like these, you might notice your floaters a lot more. This is because these activities involve body movements that can make your floaters move around more inside your eye. Because of this, you might want to stop activities like these until your brain adapts and learns to ignore your floaters. You can carry on with daily activities such as walking, gentle exercising, reading, watching TV, cooking, and using your computer. There is no evidence to suggest that flying in an aeroplane will harm your PVD or make it worse. Wearing contact lenses or makeup will also not affect your PVD.

A retinal detachment can be repaired with surgery, but it needs to be detected and, in most cases, treated quickly, or it can cause sight loss in the affected eye. A retinal detachment is an emergency. It needs to be assessed as soon as possible so that your ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) can make decisions about your treatment. How well your sight recovers can depend on how much and in what areas your retina have detached. Most people have a good level of vision following surgery to re-attach the retina if it is carried out quickly. This page contains a summary of our information on retinal detachment. To read our full information, download our Understanding Retinal Detachment guide, which is accredited by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists: There are three main causes of retinal detachment. Retinal holes and tears. Most retinal detachments happen because a tear or hole in the retina allows fluid to leak between the retinal layers, lifting the retina away from the back of the eye and causing it to detach. Tears happen because the retina has been pulled and torn. The most common cause of a retinal tear is the vitreous gel coming away from the retina (known as acute posterior vitreous detachment or PVD). Scar tissue. Eye conditions such as diabetic retinopathy can cause scar tissue to form on the surface of the retina and inside your vitreous. This scar tissue can then lead to traction (pulling on the retina), causing a detachment. Fluid. A rare type of retinal detachment happens when fluid from the blood vessels behind the retina leaks between the retinal layers without there being a hole or tear present. This type of detachment happens because of conditions which cause inflammation in the eye or tumours in the eye. Retinal detachments are rare; only about one in 10,000 people have one each year. Retinal detachments are very rare in children and are most likely to occur in people between 40 to 70 years old. Natural ageing changes in the vitreous gel, known as PVD, can cause retinal tears and PVD is more common as you get older. Anyone can develop a retinal detachment, but certain people are at higher risk. are short-sighted (the more short-sighted you are, the greater the risk) have had trauma (an injury or a blow) directly to your eye have already had a detachment in one eye (between two and 10 per cent of people have detachments in both eyes) have a family history of retinal detachment. have had previous eye surgery in that eye, such as cataract surgery have certain other eye conditions such as diabetic retinopathy or inflammation inside the eye. There are four main symptoms that can be the first signs of a retinal detachment: floaters flashing lights a dark shadow in your vision blurred vision. You may have these symptoms but not develop a retinal detachment, but there isn\u2019t a way to tell what is causing these symptoms unless your eye is examined. A retinal detachment can cause a permanent loss of vision so it\u2019s best to be cautious and have these symptoms checked, as soon as possible, within 24 hours of noticing any new symptoms. You can do this by having your eyes examined urgently by your optometrist (optician) or by attending Accident & Emergency (A&E) or eye casualty. Floaters are caused by bits of debris floating in your vitreous gel which cast a shadow onto your retina. The brain then sees this as something floating around in your vision. Floaters are very common, and most people can expect to develop some as they get older. They can take many shapes, for example, black dots, rings, spiders\u2019 legs or cobwebs. Many people naturally have some floaters in their eyes, which are nothing to worry about, but new floaters or changes to the ones you have already should be checked. If you start to see floaters or notice a change or increase in the floaters you already have, you should have your eyes examined by an optometrist (optician) or an ophthalmologist as soon as possible. If you see an optometrist and they suspect, find, or can\u2019t rule out a tear in your retina, then they will refer you urgently to an ophthalmologist. In most cases flashing lights are caused by a change in your vitreous gel (PVD). This is where the vitreous gel inside the eye moves across and tugs or stimulates the retina. These flashes of light are brief, white and vertical, occurring in the edges or sides of your vision. They may be worse when you move your eye or head and are more noticeable in darker or dimmer environments. A PVD itself is not harmful, but in some people, it may cause a retinal tear. That\u2019s why if you suddenly experience new flashing lights, you should have your eye examined by an optometrist or ophthalmologist as soon as possible. If your retina does detach, this means that it cannot work properly anymore, and you will see this as a solid dark shadow moving in from the edge of your vision. You will not be able to see round or through this shadow. If more of your retina detaches, then the shadow will keep moving towards the centre of your vision. If you experience a dark shadow moving up, down or across your vision, you must attend your local hospital Accident and Emergency (A&E) department straight away. Your vision can gradually become blurred for many reasons, and a visit to the optometrist will help you find out why. If your vision suddenly becomes blurred, especially if you also have any of the other symptoms of flashing lights, floaters or a shadow, then this is more serious. You should have your eyes examined straight away. It\u2019s important to have someone examine your eye if you start to have any of these symptoms and in most cases, it is best to have your eyes checked within 24 hours. Sometimes it is easier get an appointment with an optometrist on the high street, but they may refer you straight away to your local A&E department so that you see an ophthalmologist as soon as possible. A&E departments should have an ophthalmologist on call who can examine your eye and decide what to do next. If you have been checked for retinal detachment in the past, you should have been given clear instructions on what to do if you have further symptoms. You should follow these if more symptoms develop. This usually involves contacting the hospital eye clinic if you have any concerns. Retinal detachment can be treated by surgery to re-attach the retina to the back of the eye. The sooner surgery is carried out the better the results are likely to be. If your retinal detachment isn\u2019t treated, then you are likely to lose all the vision in the affected eye. Surgery for retinal detachment is complicated and individual to each person\u2019s eye. The type of treatment you may need depends on the type of detachment, and any complicating factors, such as any other eye conditions you may have. Once your ophthalmologist has examined your eye, they will decide how quickly surgery needs to be done \u2013 this may be within 24 hours or within a few days. There are three main types of surgery used to reattach the retina and your ophthalmologist may combine different methods depending on your detachment. They all aim to make your retina lie flat against the inside of your eye again. In each case, your ophthalmologist will also repair any tears or holes using cryotherapy or laser treatment during the surgery. The most common surgery used for a retinal detachment in the UK is a vitrectomy. During surgery your ophthalmologist removes some of the vitreous gel in your eye and replaces it with a gas bubble. Removing some of the vitreous gel helps to remove the traction (pulling) of the gel on the retina. The gas bubble holds your retina in place against the inside of your eye while it heals. The gas slowly disappears over time; it may take between two to 12 weeks depending on the type of gas used. Your ophthalmologist may choose to use clear silicone oil instead of a gas bubble. The silicone oil is heavier than gas and keeps your retina in the right place while it heals, but unlike the gas bubble you will need further surgery to remove the oil at some point in the future. Silicone oil is generally used for more complex retinal detachments. Your ophthalmologist may use a scleral buckle to treat your detachment. The sclera is the white outer layer of your eye. A scleral buckle involves attaching a tiny piece of silicone sponge or harder plastic to the outside white of your eye. This presses on the outside of the eye, causing the inside of your eye to slightly move inwards. This pushes the inside of the eye against the detached retina and into a position which helps the retina to reattach. Cryotherapy or laser treatment is then used to seal the area around the detachment. The buckle is usually left in place permanently and can\u2019t be seen once surgery is finished. If your retinal detachment is small and uncomplicated, a gas bubble can be injected into the vitreous of the eye, without removing any of the vitreous. This bubble then presses the retina back in place. Like with vitrectomy, the gas is reabsorbed over a period of weeks. This type of surgery has been found to be less successful than other types and is not often done in the UK but may be carried out for a small number of straightforward and small retinal detachments. Surgery is usually very successful at reattaching the retina, but how well your vision recovers depends on several things: how much of your retina detached if your macula was detached how long your retina was detached if you have another eye condition, such as diabetic retinopathy. If your macula, which allows you to see fine detail, remained attached, then results are often very good, and your central vision may not be affected at all. If you had a shadow in your peripheral vision, this should disappear after surgery. You may be left with some changes in your peripheral vision, which can be picked up by an eye examination, although you may not notice these on a day-to-day basis. If your macula detached, but surgery was carried out quickly, then your central vision can return, but it may be distorted. You will probably adapt to this distortion with time, especially if you have good vision in your other eye. Unfortunately, for some people, surgery may be successful at reattaching the retina, but it may not bring back detailed central vision or areas of peripheral vision. This can happen in any circumstance, but the risk is higher the longer the retina has been detached without any surgery. Around one in 10 people may need more than one operation to treat a retinal detachment. The reasons for this are new tears forming in the retina, or the formation of scar tissue which contracts and pulls the retina off again. In these cases, it is possible to have more surgery to reattach the retina. At each stage, your ophthalmologist will discuss with you the likelihood of success and the need to have more surgery or treatments. If your retinal detachment is detected early and treated successfully, you may not be left with any long-term problems with your vision once your eye has recovered from surgery. If your retinal detachment has left you with sight loss in one eye, you may still have useful vision in your other eye. It can take a few months to get used to seeing with only your good eye, because sometimes the eye with poor vision will interfere with clear vision. With time, the brain learns to ignore the eye with poorer vision in most situations. If a retinal detachment has caused sight loss in your good eye and you have a sight problem in your unaffected eye, then you may be left with sight problems. There are lots of things you can do to make the most of your remaining vision. This may mean making things bigger, using brighter lighting or using colour to make things easier to see. A low vision assessment can explore how to make the most of your sight. Your GP, optometrist or ophthalmologist can refer you to your local low vision service for an assessment.

        "source": "Retinal vessel occlusion",
        "summary": "A retinal vessel occlusion is a blockage in the blood vessel at the back of your eye that can result in sight loss.",
        "content": "There are two types of retinal blood vessels, arteries and veins. Either of these can become blocked and each of them can affect the eye in different ways. The visual loss caused by retinal vein and artery occlusions is painless, and often quite sudden. It is usual for only one eye to be involved at a time, but occasionally both eyes may be affected at the same time. This information covers both retinal artery occlusion and retinal vein occlusion. Retinal vessel occlusions are commonly caused by factors which affect the normal blood flow through blood vessels. Most commonly, artery occlusions are caused by atherosclerosis or an embolus. Atherosclerosis is a condition where plaque builds up on the inside walls of arteries. These plaques (known as atheroma) are made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, the plaques harden and narrow the arteries, which can make it difficult for the blood to flow through them easily. As these plaques grow, they can cut off some, and potentially all the blood flowing through the artery. Plaques can also cause blood clots to form which have the potential to also cause an occlusion. Sometimes, part of an atheroma plaque which forms in a larger artery, commonly in the arteries near the heart and in the neck, may break off. This piece, known as an embolus, will then flow with the blood, potentially blocking a smaller vessel downstream \u2013 this is called an embolism. An embolism can block an artery and if this happens in your retina, it\u2019s called a retinal artery occlusion. Less commonly, retinal artery occlusions may be caused by vasculitis (inflammation of the artery wall), trauma, sickle cell disease and clotting disorders. Retinal vein occlusion is commonly caused by a blood clot (thrombosis) forming in the vein, which causes the vein to become blocked. It\u2019s not always known exactly why the blood clot has formed but there are certain risk factors which affect the normal blood flow, and these can increase the risk of a blood clot forming. Atherosclerosis can also play a role in retinal vein occlusions. Veins and arteries run very closely together at the back of the eye and cross over each other. If someone has narrowing of their retinal arteries due to atherosclerosis, this can cause the hardened arteries to press onto the nearby veins, causing the veins to narrow and disturb the blood flow in them. This narrowing can potentially cause an occlusion, or the disturbed blood flow means that a clot is more likely to form in the vein, leading to retinal vein occlusion. The risk factors of developing a retinal vessel occlusion are similar to the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular diseases are diseases of the heart or blood vessels caused by atheroma and are associated with an increased risk of blood clots. Factors which increase your risk of retinal vessel occlusion include: age \u2013 most retinal vessel occlusions happen in people over 60 hypertension (high blood pressure) high cholesterol levels blood clotting disorders glaucoma or raised intraocular (eye) pressure diabetes smoking obesity. Following a retinal vessel occlusion, it\u2019s important to identify and treat any risk factors which may have led to it happening. However, in a small number of cases, no risk factors can be found, and the cause remains unknown. Treatment of any risk factors can reduce the chances of a further occlusion occurring in either eye and may also help to reduce the chances of other blood vessel blockages such as those that lead to stroke or heart attack. High blood pressure can damage blood vessels and cause hardening of arteries. High cholesterol levels can cause your blood vessels to narrow and increase your risk of developing a blood clot. Your GP can diagnose circulation problems like hypertension or high cholesterol and prescribe medication to help control them. High blood sugar levels in diabetes can damage the blood vessels, making them more likely to become narrowed. If you are diabetic, then good diabetic control can help reduce the risk of blood vessel problems. If a blood clotting disorder is identified, then this will be looked after and treated by a specialist. Lifestyle changes can also help to reduce your risk of atherosclerosis, which can also go some way to reverse the development of atherosclerotic plaques. These steps are also likely to improve your general health overall, reducing your risk of developing conditions like diabetes, stroke, and cardiovascular disease as well as retinal vessel occlusions. Stopping smoking. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen your blood can carry, as well as damaging the lining of blood vessels and making arthrosclerosis more likely. Your GP or pharmacist can give you details of your local stop smoking service for help with giving up. Eating a healthy diet. An unhealthy diet can lead to high cholesterol and high blood pressure. A healthy balanced diet is rich in fresh fruit, vegetables, fibre and wholegrain foods, and is low in salt, sugar, and saturated fats. Drinking less alcohol. Excessive alcohol consumption can increase your cholesterol and blood pressure levels and contribute to weight gain. If you drink alcohol, it is important to keep within the recommended guidelines and have several alcohol-free days a week. Keeping active. If you don't exercise regularly, it's more likely that you'll have high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and be overweight. It is thought that even a small increase in physical activity reduces your risk of atherosclerosis. You are advised to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity a week, such as cycling or brisk walking. Maintaining a healthy weight. People who are overweight are at increased risk of developing diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. You can maintain a healthy weight by eating a healthy balanced diet and exercising regularly. You can find more information about healthy eating, exercise, losing weight and NHS stop smoking services on the NHS Live Well website: www.nhs.uk/live-well People with a high eye pressure or glaucoma are more likely to have a vessel occlusion. Increased pressure in the eye has the effect of slowing the blood flow through the retinal blood vessels. Your optometrist (optician) can measure your eye pressure as part of an eye examination and refer you to an ophthalmologist if necessary. Glaucoma is where your eye pressure causes damage to the optic nerve at the back of your eye. If you have glaucoma, keeping your eye pressure under control can prevent damage to your optic nerve as well as lowering your risk of a retinal vessel occlusion. A retinal artery occlusion causes a sudden loss of sight (usually over seconds). If you suddenly lose all or part of your vision in one or both eyes, you should attend your local hospital Accident and Emergency (A&E) department straight away. Some people may experience a warning condition called amaurosis fugax. In this condition, all, or part of the vision in one eye is temporarily but suddenly lost for periods of seconds or minutes before it returns. This happens when small blockages are occurring momentarily before the circulation manages to clear them away. It is an urgent warning sign, as it means that a complete and permanent blockage is imminent. If you experience this, you should have your eyes examined as soon as possible by an optometrist or at an A&E department. Not every temporary loss of vision is due to artery occlusion, but these symptoms need investigating immediately, to work out the cause. Your retinal arteries deliver blood which is rich in oxygen to the cells of your retina. If retinal arteries become blocked, then blood and the essential oxygen cannot reach the retinal cells. Without a constant supply of fresh blood and oxygen, the cells of the retina are quickly damaged, and this means that the cells stop working and sight can be permanently lost. The amount of sight lost depends on where the blockage has occurred. The main artery supplying your retina enters your eye with your optic nerve; this is called the central retinal artery. At the point it enters the eye, the central artery splits in half, one branch for the upper retina, and another branch for the lower retina. In turn each branch splits again, to a left and a right side. In total, there are four branch arteries supplying blood to all areas of your retina. If the central artery becomes blocked, then little to no blood will enter your eye, and it will affect all your vision in that eye. This type of occlusion is a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). If the blockage happens in one of the branch arteries, then only a certain area of your sight in that eye will be affected. This type of blockage is a branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO). Unfortunately, there is little treatment that can help to bring back sight following a retinal artery occlusion. The cells on the retina are very sensitive to a lack of blood supply, which can result in permanent sight loss. Although the chances of restoring any vision are low, if you are seen at the hospital within a few hours of having a retinal artery occlusion, then your ophthalmologist may try some treatment to dislodge the blockage and get the blood flowing again. If a blockage can be moved further downstream in the artery, less of the retina is affected by the blockage resulting in a smaller area of vision loss. However, even though the blockage may move, the retinal cells may have already been permanently affected from the lack of blood supply, so there is no single guaranteed treatment that can restore vision. Your ophthalmologist may lower your eye pressure in an attempt to dislodge the blockage. By lowering the pressure inside your eye, the vessel can expand, and the blood may flow more easily. The eye pressure is lowered by using medications (tablets and eye drops) or using a small needle (under anaesthetic) to take some fluid out of the eye. Firmly massaging your eye may also be tried. This causes a repeated raising and lowering of the eye pressure, which may dislodge the blockage and allow the blood to flow again. If the blockage moves quickly, then an improvement in your vision may be seen. How much improvement you see will depend on how long it has been before the blockage started to move, and how far it moves. Most people however still have permanent changes in their vision, as unfortunately there\u2019s no treatment available to reverse the damage to cells caused by the lack of blood supply. As a retinal artery occlusion is commonly only in one eye, most people manage with the sight from their other eye; although you will require a period of adjustment to your new level of vision. After a retinal artery occlusion, it is crucial to have further tests, usually by your GP, to try and find out if there is an underlying risk factor that may have caused this. This means looking for and treating underlying risk factors such as high blood pressure, cholesterol or diabetes. You may have blood tests to check for any blood clotting disorders. You may also have an assessment of the arteries in your neck (carotid arteries) to see whether they contain atheroma plaques which may need to be removed with a surgical procedure. Although these things can\u2019t reverse the sight loss which has already happened, it can prevent the chances of an occlusion happening again in the future, either in the other eye or elsewhere in the body. A retinal vein occlusion causes a dimming or blurring of all or part of your sight in one eye over a period of hours or days. If you experience any change in your vision you should have your eyes examined as soon as possible. Your optometrist is best placed to examine your eyes for milder vision changes, however if you feel your sight has deteriorated a lot or very quickly, you should visit your local A&E department as soon as possible. The retinal veins drain away used blood from the retinal cells. When one of these veins becomes blocked, then the used blood cannot drain away. This causes the blood to collect in the veins and leak out into the retina, resulting in swelling and haemorrhages (bleeding). These areas of swelling and bleeding damage the cells of the retina, which can affect your sight. How much sight is affected depends on where the blockage takes place. The veins are spread out all over the retina but join together to form larger veins. Like the arteries, there are four branch veins that join together to form the central retinal vein that leaves the eye through the optic nerve at the back of your eye. If the blockage is in the central retinal vein (known as a central retinal vein occlusion or CRVO) it can affect all your vision in that eye. If it is in one of the branch retinal veins (known as a branch retinal vein occlusion or BRVO), then it will usually affect a smaller area of your sight in that eye. A branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) may only cause a small amount or area of vision loss. It can often get better without any treatment. A central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) causes more of your vision to be affected, usually all the vision in the eye. Some of the changes to your vision may be caused by the swelling and bleeding the occlusion causes. With time, this swelling can improve, and the blood is reabsorbed. This can mean your sight may get better. Your ophthalmologist may choose to wait for a few months and monitor your eye for signs of improvement, before starting any treatment. There is no treatment for the vein occlusion itself but there are treatments for the complications which can develop after a vein occlusion. Your ophthalmologist will discuss with you whether you need treatment depending on whether you have developed any complications from the vein occlusion. If treatment is recommended, they will explore which type of treatment you need and the timing of the treatment. Treatment is not always needed when you first have a vein occlusion, but you will still be monitored by the eye clinic. It is likely that you will continue to be monitored for up to two years, whether you have treatment or not. Your ophthalmologist will also want to do some tests to check for any underlying risk factors which may have led to a retinal vein occlusion. Some of these tests may be done at the eye clinic, such as blood pressure or blood sugar tests. You will normally be advised to see your GP for further investigations into risk factors and management of these. Sometimes the blood tests (and possibly other investigations) do not find anything wrong. If a cause is suspected, then it can be treated or managed to reduce the risk of another occlusion occurring in the other eye. If you have a retinal vein occlusion, one or more of the following complications may mean you need treatment: macula oedema (swelling of your central retina) neovascularisation (new blood vessel growth) high eye pressure (glaucoma). The most common need for treatment is if you have macular oedema \u2013 this is when your central macular area of your retina is swollen with fluid. It is caused by a damaged vein, which leaks fluid and collects at your macula. Macula oedema can cause problems with your central vision, causing blurring and distortion. This can lead to difficulties recognising faces, reading, or watching television with that eye. If you have macular oedema your ophthalmologist may suggest treatment with anti-VEGF injections or steroid injections. If your macula oedema is mild, your ophthalmologist may suggest monitoring this for a while as the fluid can sometimes resolve on its own. If your macula oedema needs treatment, then the earlier treatment is given the better the outcome can be for your sight. If a large part of your retina is affected by the retinal vein occlusion, like in a central retinal vein occlusion, areas of the retina become starved of oxygen. This is called ischaemia. The eye responds to ischaemia by attempting to grow new blood vessels, a process called neovascularisation. This is nature\u2019s way of trying to repair the damage by growing a new blood supply to the oxygen-starved area of your retina. Unfortunately, these new blood vessels have weak walls, and grow in the wrong places. They can grow on the surface of the retina or on the iris at the front of the eye. These blood vessels bleed very easily. New blood vessels on the retina can result in more haemorrhages and damage to the retina, or bleeding into the vitreous of the eye. At the iris, new blood vessels can cause your eye pressure to rise and lead to glaucoma. Most people do not get neovascularisation after a vein occlusion, though if you do, it can be treated with a laser. New blood vessel growth at the iris can cause your eye pressure to rise and this can lead to glaucoma. Your eye produces a fluid called aqueous humour, which is always being drained from your eye. The fluid is drained at the angle between your iris and cornea. If you have growth of new blood vessels in this area, it can cause the drainage angle to become blocked and cause the pressure in your eye to rise. If the pressure in your eye is too high, it can cause damage to your optic nerve \u2013 this is called glaucoma. This is rare, but on average happens around 100 days after the initial vein occlusion, hence is often called 100-day glaucoma. It may also be called new vessel glaucoma (NVG), or rubeotic glaucoma. If your ophthalmologist sees growth of new vessels in this area, then they will offer you laser treatment. You may also need eye drops and more rarely, surgery, to control your eye pressure. Since the main cause of a vessel occlusion is atherosclerosis, and this is affected by a range of general health issues, your GP will have a key role after you have had a vessel occlusion. It is likely that they will want to monitor risk factors such as your blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels more closely, and you may be prescribed new or more medications to help control these. Your GP can also provide advice and help with stopping smoking and with managing your weight, as well as advice on exercise. Taking steps to manage these things can improve your general blood circulation and reduce your chance of having a similar occlusion in your other eye. How much a vessel occlusion will affect your sight varies from person to person. Retinal vessel occlusions usually only affect one eye. Some people do not notice much difference unless they cover the unaffected eye, and others are very aware of the change all the time. Because you use both eyes together to see in three dimensions (3D), when one eye is affected, you may have difficulty judging distances. You may feel clumsy, misjudge steps, pavements and the position of objects, for example cups. However, after a few months you will probably find that this becomes less of a problem. This is because our brains are able to adjust to a new level of vision and are able to make the eye with good sight the dominant one. Usually, people find that with time their good eye \u2018takes over\u2019 and that tasks that were previously difficult become easier. You may be able to continue driving a car or motorcycle if the vision in your other eye is unaffected by other eye conditions, and you can meet the visual requirements for driving. You\u2019re required by law to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) if you have any eye conditions which may affect your vision in both eyes. Ask your optometrist or your ophthalmologist for advice about whether your sight meets DVLA standards and whether you can continue driving. Even if you\u2019re told that your sight does meet DVLA standards, you may be advised to wait until you have adapted to having poorer vision in one eye before you resume driving. If the affected eye was your good eye and you have a sight problem in your other eye, then you may need to make changes or use aids to make the most of your remaining sight. This may mean making things bigger, using brighter lighting, or using colour to make things easier to see. You should ask your ophthalmologist, optometrist or GP about low vision aids and getting a low vision assessment. During this assessment with a low vision specialist, you\u2019ll be able to discuss the use of magnifiers and aids to help you to see things more clearly.

        "source": "Stargardt disease",
        "summary": "Stargardt disease is an inherited eye condition that affects your macula, which is the tiny central part of your retina; the light-sensitive layer at the back of your eye.",
        "content": "It causes a reduction in your central detailed vision, which is the vision you use when looking directly at something. For most people with Stargardt, it doesn't usually affect your peripheral or side vision, so you don't lose all your sight. Stargardt disease is also known as Stargardt macular dystrophy, juvenile macular dystrophy and fundus flavimaculatus. This page contains a summary of our information on Stargardt disease. To read our full information, download our factsheet: The macula is the small central area of your retina where the light entering your eye is focused. The retina is made up of cells called photoreceptors which are cells that are sensitive to light. The macula is a specialised area that contains a high concentration of photoreceptor cells called cone cells. Cone cells work best in bright light and allow you to see fine detail for activities such as reading and watching television, as well as seeing colour. Therefore, the macula is very important and is responsible for: What you see straight in front of you The vision you need for detailed activities such as reading and writing Your ability to appreciate colour. Away from the central macula is the peripheral retina, made up of mostly the other type of photoreceptor called rod cells, and some cone cells as well. Rod cells enable us to see in dim conditions and provide peripheral (side) vision outside of the main line of sight. The cone cells in the peripheral retina give peripheral vision in normal daylight conditions. Stargardt disease is sometimes called a juvenile macular dystrophy as it can first appear in childhood. However, Startgardt disease can also begin later in young adults and late adulthood. At first Stargardt disease can make your vision unclear or blurry. Things may sometimes appear distorted or wavy. You can have problems with your central, detailed vision which can make activities such as reading and recognising faces difficult. Your colour perception may also be affected. If you\u2019ve had Stargardt disease for a number of years, then you may have a blank patch in the centre of your vision. This blank patch will not move and will always be in the very centre of your field of vision. There are forms of Stargardt that can affect your side or peripheral vision, but for most people with the condition, it is the central vision that is affected. Since you use your peripheral vision when you\u2019re moving around, most people with Stargardt disease can manage to continue getting out and about on their own. Stargardt disease can also cause problems with light, such as glare and difficulties adapting to changing light conditions. Stargardt disease is an inherited condition that is caused by a change or variation in one of our genes. In Stargardt, this variation in the gene leads to a build-up of a waste product, lipofuscin, and this can eventually damage the cone cells in the macula. When genes are identified they are given names usually made up of numbers and letters. The genes associated with Stargardt are ABCA4, ELOVL4 and PROM1. The gene responsible for most cases of Stargardt disease is ABCA4. All genes come in pairs, and you inherit one of each pair from your mother and one of each pair from your father. Your genes determine the many things which make you an individual such as hair or eye colour. There are several ways a genetic condition can be passed through genes. If Stargardt disease is caused by a variation in the ABCA4 gene, then it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. If a variation in the ELOVL4 gene is responsible, then Stargardt disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Most cases of Stargardt are inherited in a recessive pattern. A recessive condition can only be inherited when you get two \"variant\" genes, one from each parent. Therefore, both parents have to carry a variant gene. If your parents have one \"normal\" gene and one variant gene, they are carriers of Stargardt and their sight won\u2019t be affected. This is because the normal gene compensates for the variant gene. If both your parents pass on their variant ABCA4 gene, then you have two of these variant genes, and will inherit Stargardt disease. Dominant inheritance means that you inherit a disease from only one of your parents. The variant gene that you inherit from one parent is the dominant one and over-rides the normal gene from your other parent. Usually, the parent who has passed on the variant gene will also have Stargardt disease. When a parent with the dominant ELOVL4 Stargardt gene has a child with someone who does not carry the Stargardt gene, there is a 50 per cent chance that the variant gene will be passed to a child. If a child does not inherit the variant gene, they cannot pass it on to their children. A small number of cases of Stargardt disease are inherited in a dominant pattern. Most people who have Stargardt disease have parents who don't have the condition. This means that Stargardt often occurs in families that have no history of the disease in the past. For more information on how Stargardt disease may be passed through your family, you may want to speak to your GP about a referral to a clinical geneticist (a doctor who specialises in genetic conditions). They can discuss your situation with you and your family in more detail. You may also wish to contact the Genetic Alliance for more information on genetics. Stargardt disease causes changes to the appearance of the macula area of your retina. If affects the vision by causing the photoreceptor cells of the macula to be lost over time. When the ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) looks into your eye to examine your retina they may notice differences which can help them to diagnose the condition: Yellowish flecks which surround your macula are very characteristic of Stargardt disease. These yellow flecks are lipofuscin which is a by-product of cell activity. As the disease progresses, an oval lesion can be seen which is often referred to as \u201cbeaten bronze\u201d in appearance within your macular area. Sometimes people have just the flecks without the macular lesion, and in the past, these people may have been diagnosed with an eye condition called fundus flavimaculatus. However, researchers now believe that these two problems, the macular lesion and the yellow flecks, are part of the same genetic problem, but are just expressed in different ways. Although there is currently no treatment for Stargardt disease, there is much that can be done to make the most of the vision you have. This may mean making things bigger, using brighter lighting, or using colour and contract to make things easier to see. You can also find out tips for making the most of your sight by downloading our guide: It is hoped that current research and developments into drug and gene therapies will lead to treatments soon for those that are in the early stages of Stargardt, while stem cell therapy can give hope to those who have had the condition for a while. An active area of research is looking at medications that can reduce the amount of vitamin A by-product that builds up in the eyes of those with Stargardt disease. If you have Stargardt disease, you aren't able to clear vitamin A by-product in your eye due to the variant gene. These by-products collect in the macula and this affects how well the cells work, leading to your sight being affected. If you're diagnosed with Stargardt, you should avoid taking supplements containing vitamin A. There is further information on the role of vitamin A on Stargardt's Connected website. Gene therapy aims to replace the variant gene such as ABCA4 within the affected retinal cells with a new gene that works properly. The normal gene is injected into the eye of the person with Stargardt disease. The hope is that the affected cells then begin to work correctly thereby stopping the progression of the disease. Stem cells are cells that can divide many times and can replace damaged or missing cells in different organs and tissues of the body. If stem cells can be turned into the specialised retinal cells, it may be possible to replace the cells that have been damaged in Stargardt disease. Researchers have reported that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light may theoretically cause further toxic by-products leading to retinal damage. Therefore, protecting your eyes from UV and blue light with sunglasses that have 100 per cent UV filtering might be helpful. Wraparound styles provide protection from light coming in from the sides and tops. We have more information on choosing sunglasses. Being diagnosed with an eye condition can be very upsetting.

Stargardt disease can cause severe problems with your central vision. However, most people with the condition retain their peripheral vision, so won\u2019t lose their sight completely. There are lots of things that you can do to make the most of the vision you have. This may mean making things bigger or smaller, using brighter lighting or using colour to make things easier to see. A low vision assessment can explore how to make the most of your sight. Your GP, optometrist or ophthalmologist can refer you to your local low vision service for an assessment. You should also ask whether you are eligible to register as sight impaired (partially sighted) or severely sight impaired (blind). Registration can act as your passport to expert help and sometimes to financial concessions. Even if you aren\u2019t registered a lot of this support is still available to you. Local social services should also be able to offer you information on staying safe in your home and getting out and about safely. They should also be able to offer you some practical mobility training to give you more confidence when you are out. Our Sight Loss Advice Service can also give you practical guidance on living with sight loss, and our Online Shop has products that can make everyday tasks easier.

        "summary": "Strabismus, often referred to as a squint and sometimes as a \"turn\" in the eye is an eye condition where the eyes do not look in the same direction as each other.",
        "content": "This means that while one eye looks forwards to focus on an object, the other eye turns either inwards, outwards, upwards or downwards. The eyes do not work together as a pair all the time. Most strabismus develops in young children. Strabismus can also develop in adults, but an adult will develop strabismus for different reasons than a child will. This information will focus on childhood strabismus. For the purpose of this information, we will refer to the medical terms, strabismus for squint and amblyopia for lazy eye. For further information on this topic, please download the full factsheet by clicking the link. Most people have eyes that work together as a pair. When you look at an object your eyes will be pointing in the same direction and focusing at the same point. Your brain will receive similar but slightly different pictures from each eye so it can join them together to allow you to have binocular and three-dimensional (3D) vision. This allows you to have depth perception (also known as stereopsis) and to judge how far away things are. The movement of each eye is controlled by six muscles that move your eyeball in different directions. The muscles for one eye also work and coordinate with the muscles from your other eye so that they can work together. When you are born, your eyes and brain must learn to work together. As you grow you use your eyes to collect information which is sent to the brain to process and this builds up a connection between them. This connection between the eyes and the brain is known as the visual pathway. The visual pathway develops throughout your childhood and up to the age of about eight years old. During this time, it\u2019s important that your eyes send clear and similar images to your brain. The eyes and brain use your visual experiences to improve their coordination and allow your visual pathway to develop as fully as possible. This allows a good level of vision to develop in each eye separately as well as allowing the two eyes to work together as a pair to allow you to see in 3D. After the age of about eight years old, the visual pathways and the \"seeing\" parts of the brain are nearly fully formed and are difficult to change. Therefore, it\u2019s important to treat childhood vision problems before this age. Strabismus is common and affects around three per hundred children in the UK (not far off an average of one child in every class of 30). Strabismus is where one of your eyes points in a different direction from the other eye. This may be more noticeable when a child focuses on a small object, is tired or feeling unwell, although in some children the strabismus is noticeable when they are not focusing directly on something. When your child is born their eyes and brains do not work well together. Over the first few months you may notice your baby\u2019s eyes appear to squint or move separately from each other every now and again. This is normal and usually gets better by around two months and should be gone by the time they reach four months. If this isn't the case, you should speak to your GP or health visitor about a referral for a full assessment with your hospital eye department. More commonly strabismus will develop a little later in your child's life often between the ages of 18 months and four years old. If you notice that your child appears to have a strabismus, it\u2019s important to have this checked by an optometrist (also known as an optician) as soon as possible. Children are entitled to a free NHS eye test. Your optometrist may be able to correct the strabismus (for example with glasses). If your optometrist cannot correct it, they will then be able to refer your child to the hospital eye clinic to be seen by an orthoptist (a professional who investigates and manages strabismus). Your child\u2019s strabismus may be described in different ways by the professionals looking after your child\u2019s eyes. Some of the words you may hear will have particular meanings when used to describe the strabismus. The strabismus may be described depending on: When it can be seen: constant, if it is visible all the time, and intermittent if it comes and goes. The strabismus may be described as refractive if it is caused by a focusing problem and non-refractive if it isn't. Which eye appears to be affected: either left or right, or alternating, where the strabismus can alternate from one eye to the other. Which way the eye turns: if the turn is inwards it is called a convergent strabismus or esotropia, if the turn is outwards it is called a divergent strabismus or exotropia, if the turn is upwards it is called a hypertropia, if the turn is downwards it is called a hypotropia. This means that your child's squint can be carefully categorised by the professionals involved and they may describe your child\u2019s strabismus using a mixture of these words, for example, an \u201cintermittent convergent squint\u201d. Knowing the nature of your child's squint and labelling it as accurately as possible can help to decide how it can be dealt with. Some common types of childhood strabismus include: Congenital or infantile esotropia. This is an inward turning strabismus which normally develops in the first six months of life. Accommodative esotropia. This type of strabismus is caused by long-sightedness (hypermetropia) which causes an inward turning strabismus. The strabismus can be improved or removed by wearing glasses. Non-accommodative esotropia. This type of inward turning squint usually develops in children between two and five years old, and is a strabismus which isn\u2019t improved by wearing any glasses. Intermittent distance exotropia. This is an outward turning strabismus which comes and goes, usually being more apparent when a child is looking at things in the distance. Commonly, parents may notice that the eye turns out when the child is tired, daydreaming or in bright sunlight. A child may also close or rub one eye when they are out in bright sunlight. The aims of treatment for strabismus in childhood are to make sure that the vision in each eye develops normally, thereby preventing the development of amblyopia and to help the two eyes work together so that binocular and 3D vision can develop as well as possible. For treatment to be successful, it needs to be given before the visual pathway finishes developing (ideally before the age of about eight years). Some of the most common ways that squint can be treated include: Glasses Occlusion therapy (patching) Exercises Surgery For more detailed information on the treatments for strabismus, please download the full factsheet in the link above. If your child develops strabismus, it means each eye is looking in a different direction and their eyes are sending different pictures to the brain. Their brain finds it difficult to merge the two pictures into one clear image because the pictures are so different. This means their eyes have stopped working together and would ordinarily, in an adult, cause double vision. However, as your child's visual system is still developing the brain can easily adapt to stop this double vision by ignoring the image coming from the eye with the strabismus. They will use only the vision from their better/straight eye. The brain \"switching off\" the vision from the eye with strabismus is called \"suppression\" and this may cause the vision in that eye to become poor because it is not being used. Children can easily adapt to using one eye and it may not be obvious from how they are acting that they have any problems with their eyes and vision. This may only be detected by having your child's eye tested by an eye health professional. Amblyopia (lazy eye) is a condition that can develop during childhood when one eye does not send a good clear image to the brain. This could be because of a strabismus or an inability to focus clearly. As the brain finds it difficult to fuse together the images from the better eye and the weaker eye, it learns to ignore the blurred image from the weaker eye over time. This means the visual pathway of the weaker eye won\u2019t develop very well and the vision in that eye will be blurred even when your child is wearing the correct glasses. An eye which has amblyopia can be called an amblyopic eye or may be referred to as a \"lazy\" eye. Although the vision is not clear, the eye may still be completely healthy in many cases. Strabismus may be noticed by parents, relatives, friends or your health visitor or GP. Routine checks to detect eye problems in babies and children are usually done at the new-born examination and at the six to eight week review. There should also be a routine eye screening for when children start school (at the age of between four and five years old) to ensure that their vision is good and that their eyes work together. This screening is usually managed and sometimes carried out by professionals known as orthoptists, who detect and help manage any treatment needed for strabismus. Unfortunately, this screening may not happen in some parts of the country and if you are in any doubt about whether your child's vision has been checked, you should ask at your child's school or nursery. If you are concerned about your child's eyes at any age before this check because you have noticed a squint or other symptoms, then you should discuss this with an optometrist or your child\u2019s GP or health visitor and ask to be referred to an orthoptist. Orthoptists are usually based in the eye clinic at the hospital and are recommended to carry out or manage the children's screening service at four to five years old. They are experts in how the two eyes work together (known as binocular vision) and this includes strabismus, double vision and amblyopia. If your child is suspected to have any of these conditions, they are usually one of the first professionals they will see if they are referred to the hospital. Orthoptists are extremely skilled in testing vision in young children, diagnosing strabismus, prescribing patching therapy and any eye exercises that may help. Most hospital appointments about your child\u2019s strabismus will be with an orthoptist. Ophthalmologists are hospital-based eye doctors. Their job is to diagnose eye conditions and perform any treatment or surgery that may be needed. If your child has been referred to the hospital for a strabismus, they may see an ophthalmologist to check the health of their eyes and make sure there is no underlying eye condition causing the strabismus. Optometrists (also known as opticians) are experts at testing your vision and prescribing glasses. They are also qualified to detect eye conditions or problems, including strabismus and binocular vision problems. If your child is prescribed glasses to help treat their strabismus then you may see an optometrist in the community or at the hospital to supply your child\u2019s glasses. Optometrists can also manage some types of squint. Dispensing opticians are qualified in the dispensing and fitting of spectacles and can give professional advice about suitable frames and lenses for children. They usually work in community optical practices and in some hospital eye clinics. The treatments for squint and amblyopia are generally very effective if the squint is detected and treated early. In these cases, most children will have good vision in each eye in the long-term. If a strabismus or amblyopia is not picked up before the age of about eight years old, it is less likely that treatment will be as effective as if the problem is treated earlier. The level of vision in this eye will vary between individuals and some may retain a reasonable level of sight. Most people who have had strabismus or amblyopia since childhood that hasn\u2019t been successfully treated are totally adapted to having poorer vision in one eye and it doesn\u2019t cause them any problems day to day. Poor vision in one eye can reduce depth perception which can cause difficulties with judging distances as well as activities such as catching a ball or navigating steps. However, children with a lazy eye are totally adapted to this and their brain finds other ways of judging distances, so these difficulties are generally not a problem. If your child has strabismus or amblyopia, they won\u2019t be able to fully see the 3D effects in 3D films. In the future, even if they have reduced vision in one eye your child would still be able to drive a car if the vision in their remaining eye is unaffected by other eye conditions and meets the driving standard. Some professions, such as being a pilot, police officer, some professional drivers, or some roles in the forces require a certain level of vision to be reached in both eyes and for both eyes to be working together. Keeping this in mind can help you and your child plan their career choice for the future. You can ask your orthoptist or optometrist for more information about certain jobs and whether your child may be affected by this. Sometimes adults who have had squint surgery as a child may need to have further surgery later in life to straighten the eyes again. It\u2019s completely natural to be worried when your child is diagnosed with strabismus or amblyopia, particularly if you haven\u2019t noticed any problems with their eyes. It can be reassuring to know that prompt diagnosis and assessment of these conditions usually means that they can be dealt with and often treated successfully. Children whose treatment isn\u2019t as successful may have poor sight in one eye. This may not cause them any problems throughout their life as many people adjust very well to poor vision in one eye only. However, it\u2019s important that someone with good vision in only one eye should have regular eye examinations with an optometrist to make sure that the eye they rely on is healthy. An optometrist will be able to give you advice on how often your child should have their eyes tested."

        "source": "Stroke-related eye conditions",
        "summary": "Strokes occur when a part of your brain is starved of oxygen and nutrients.",
        "content": "Vision problems following a stroke are quite common. Our eyes send visual information to different parts of the brain involved in seeing. This is known as the visual pathway. If a stroke affects certain parts of the visual pathway or parts of the brain that are involved in processing and interpreting visual information, then this can affect your sight. The main types of eye problems that can occur after a stroke include visual field loss, eye movement problems and visual processing problems. This page contains a summary of our information on stroke-related eye conditions. To read our full information, download our factsheet: We also offer support for coping with the conditions and are here if you need to talk to us. Stroke can affect the visual pathways of your eye and this can affect your vision in different ways including: visual field loss blurry vision double vision reading difficulty moving images other problems such as dry eye and sensitivity to light. When stroke affects the areas of your brain that process information you see, it can cause problems such as: visual neglect judging depth and movement recognising objects and people visual hallucinations. The focus following a stroke is on rehabilitation. Part of the rehabilitation programme for someone who has had a stroke normally includes an assessment of their vision and eyes. Orthoptists and low vision specialists can assess and work with you on visual training with or without optical aids. The stroke team, GP, or ophthalmologist (hospital eye doctor) can refer you for an orthoptic assessment and/or to the low vision clinic. There are different techniques that can be used to try to help deal with the visual effects of stroke. These will depend on how the stroke has affected your vision but can include glasses, prisms on glasses, patching, magnifiers and visual scanning techniques. There are also computer-based rehabilitation programmes which may help improve your ability to scan if you have visual field loss. Some people may see some improvement in their vision for many months following a stroke, more commonly after an ischaemic stroke. However, this is very individual and really depends on where in your brain the damage has occurred, the extent of the damage and the type of stroke you have had, as well as any other existing health problems. Unfortunately for many people, especially those with visual field loss, sight loss may be permanent. A common problem that can affect your sight after a stroke is loss of part or whole sections of your visual field. Visual field is the term used to describe the entire area that you can see when your eyes are fixed in one position. It refers to everything you can see in the periphery (side) of your vision as well as what you can see looking directly at something (central vision). Hemianopia is where there is a loss of one half of your visual field. This may mean that you\u2019re not able to see to either the left or right from the centre of your field of vision in both eyes. If you have a stroke to one side of your brain, you may develop field loss to the opposite side. For example, if the right side of your brain has been affected by the stroke, the left side vision in each eye may be affected. Although hemianopia does not affect all of your vision, it can still cause problems with day to day living such as locating things, coping with traffic on the street, or being disoriented in crowded environments such as supermarkets. Reading can also be a very frustrating experience with hemianopia as words and sentences disappear when in the missing visual field. Sometimes using a marker at the end of the sentence or a Post-it Note to indicate where the end of the line is can be helpful. A typoscope (a piece of card with a rectangle box cut out) or a bar magnifier (a long thin magnifier with a guideline on it) can be helpful by making it easier to focus on a line of text at a time. It may also be helpful to tilt the text and read it vertically. Sometimes with hemianopia you may not be aware that you\u2019re unable to see from a part of your visual field. You can be taught scanning techniques (eye movement patterns) in the direction of the hemianopia in order to compensate. Scanning exercises are easy to do and can be done in different ways. You can practice scanning by keeping your head still and moving your eyes around the room to your affected side of vision. You could also use puzzles and word search games in books or on computers and tablet screens to improve your visual perception and visual-tracking skills. There are free scanning training programmes on the internet which can be helpful: Eye-Search Read-Right Durham Reading and Exploration Training These computer-based scanning programmes will not help you recover any visual field loss but can help you get the most out of your remaining field of vision. Scanning exercises have been shown to be beneficial as a treatment to improve your speed and accuracy in finding objects on your affected side. For more information about what it's like to have hemianopia, watch our film which features Tim, who has the condition, and Professor Leff, a neuro-ophthalmologist. Damage to the nerves that control your eyes can lead to eye movement problems after a stroke which can result in both your eyes not working together as a pair. This can make it difficult to maintain stable focus on things because of blurred vision as well as double vision (diplopia). You may also experience weakness in your eye muscles, like difficulty or even inability to follow objects with your eyes (pursuit) or shift vision quickly from object to object (saccade) which may make it difficult for you to focus or track objects. In addition, your eyes may wobble (a condition known as nystagmus), or you may not be able to move both eyes together in a particular direction (gaze palsy). Treatment can involve prisms and occlusion or patching. Prisms for eye movement problems are used to help eliminate double vision and are very effective when the size of the double vision does not change significantly as you look around. In the initial stages following a stroke, the double vision may change and therefore, a temporary prism may be recommended for use by your orthoptist. Once the double vision and strength of prism needed becomes stable, the temporary prism can be replaced with a permanent prism incorporated into the glasses lens itself. Occluding one eye fully or partially can also be an effective solution for double vision. Usually, occlusion is done by applying a frosting sticker to one lens of your glasses. After a stroke, you may have difficulty with visual processing or your ability to make sense of what you see. The most common visual processing problem after a stroke is visual neglect, also known as spatial inattention, which can affect your perception of things around you as you may be unaware of objects to one side. Visual neglect is more common when you have a stroke in the right side of the brain which affects the left side of the body. It may occur when you have visual field loss but can occur on its own as well. You may even be unaware of one entire side of your body. If you experience neglect, then you may ignore food on one half of your plate, avoid shaving or applying make-up to one side of your face as well as be unaware of objects and people that are on your affected side causing you to ignore or bump into objects that are on that side. Treatment for neglect can include prisms, but most often you\u2019re advised on using scanning and awareness strategies to help you cope with the neglect. Unfortunately, if you have both visual field loss and neglect, you\u2019re less likely to respond to scanning techniques or compensate for the problem. Other problems that can affect your eyes or vision after a stroke include increased sensitivity to light, dry eye, visual balance disorders and processing problems. Sensitivity to light can occur when the brain seems to have difficulty adjusting to different levels of light. You might notice that bright lights are uncomfortable. Tinted glasses or specially designed eye shields can help in easing the discomfort you might have. Some people find it is easier to read when placing a yellow transparent plastic sheet over their reading material as this reduces glare. Dry eye following a stroke can be due to problems with the nerves of the eyelid, the facial nerve or the muscles of the eyelid. The rate that you blink may be slower following a stroke and/or you may not be able to close your eyelids completely. If you\u2019re not able to blink or close your eyes completely, it can cause a part of your cornea, the clear front surface of your eye, to dry out causing your eye to feel gritty and uncomfortable. Using artificial tear eyedrops to keep your cornea lubricated, using ointment when sleeping, and reminding yourself to try to blink often and completely, may help you to manage dry eye. Often a person after a stroke may be able to read text readily but is unable to make sense of the text. They may attribute this to not being able to see the text properly when it\u2019s due to failure of processing the information that they\u2019ve read. Some people may have \"visual agnosia\" where they are able to see objects or people but have trouble in recognising them. These difficulties are not related to vision itself but a result of damage to parts of the brain that perceive and interpret what you see. Orthoptists play an important role in assessing and managing many of the visual problems that may result after a stroke. Visual training with or without optical aids can be led by orthoptists as well as professionals in low vision and optometrists. In addition, doctors, physiotherapists, speech therapists, rehabilitation workers, nurses and occupational therapists all play a major role in the rehabilitation and recovery process of people who have had a stroke. If you experience any visual difficulties following a stroke, it\u2019s important that you have your eyes examined by eye care specialists. There are also some useful resources available for people with vision problems following a stroke on the following links: VISION Research Unit British and Irish Orthoptic Society (BIOS) It\u2019s completely natural to be upset when you\u2019ve been diagnosed with vision loss.

        "source": "Thyroid eye disease",
        "summary": "Thyroid eye disease (TED) is an eye condition that usually occurs when you have a problem with your thyroid gland.",
        "content": "It causes the eye muscles, eyelids, tear glands and soft tissues in and around your eye socket to become inflamed. The period of inflammation and swelling of these tissues is known as the \"active\" stage. The active stage may resolve on its own, but sometimes needs treatment so it\u2019s important to have any symptoms of TED checked early. It commonly lasts about six months to two years. After this, the inflammation settles, and this is known as the \"inactive\" or \"burnt out\" stage. TED may also be called thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), thyroid orbitopathy, Graves\u2019 orbitopathy or Graves\u2019 ophthalmopathy (GO). This page contains a summary of our information on TED. To read our full information, download our factsheet: Your thyroid gland is in your neck and produces thyroid hormones that help regulate metabolism (the speed with which the cells of your body work). Occasionally it can produce too much thyroid hormone (overactive thyroid) or too little (underactive thyroid). TED most commonly occurs when you have an overactive thyroid but can also occur with an underactive thyroid or even when the thyroid is working normally. The most common cause of an overactive thyroid gland is Graves\u2019 disease, which is an autoimmune condition. In Graves\u2019 disease, an autoimmune response produces antibodies that cause the thyroid gland to make more of its hormones. At the same time, the antibodies attacking your thyroid gland also attack the soft tissues behind your eyes (orbital contents), leading to swelling and inflammation. The way that TED can affect your eyes can vary between different people. The most common way TED affects the eyes is by causing symptoms watering, grittiness, and soreness. You may also find that bright lights are uncomfortable. These symptoms are caused by inflammation and dry eye. Dry eye can happen when your lacrimal gland, which produces the tears in your eyes, is affected by TED. If the soft tissues around your eye become inflamed, they become red and swollen and cause some changes to your eyes: Your eyelids can become puffy and red (lid swelling), which is often more obvious in the morning. Your upper eyelid can rise to a higher position than normal, known as eyelid retraction. This can make more of the white of your eye visible, giving a \"staring\" appearance. The muscles and fat (soft tissues) behind your eyeball can swell, pushing your eyes forward so that they \"bulge\" (called \"exophthalmos\", or \"proptosis\"). Both eyelid retraction and exophthalmos can make your dry eye symptoms worse. This is because more of your eye\u2019s surface is exposed and because these changes mean your eyelids are unable to blink or close fully. Your orbits (eye sockets) may become painful, particularly when your eyes move. If the muscles that move the eyeball become swollen, this can mean your eyes are unable to move together and equally as they should, causing double vision (diplopia). You may only have double vision when looking in one particular direction or you may have double vision all the time, whatever direction you are looking in. If the pressure inside your eye sockets increases, it can squash (compress) the optic nerve, which can cause blurring or dimming of your vision. Very few people with TED experience this, but it\u2019s important to get medical attention straight away if you notice these changes to your vision. Most people only get a mild form of TED, although the symptoms can be difficult to cope with. You may have dry eye which can usually be managed well with lubricating eye drops. You may have some eyelid retraction or exophthalmos and any double vision you have may come and go. Many people may only experience these changes mildly and they can be temporary and short-lived. However, they can still affect your quality of life. Often the symptoms of TED get worse for six months to a year, but after that the appearance of your eyes should improve. During the active stage of TED, treatments are aimed at improving your symptoms and protecting your eyes while the active stage of the condition runs its course. Symptoms can fluctuate during the active stage which can last months or a couple of years. Most commonly, during the active stage, treatment involves treating dry eyes or double vision. Symptoms of dry eye can be managed with artificial tear eye drops, and double vision may be managed with prisms or occlusion (covering one eye). For most people, this is all the treatment they will need at this stage and the condition won\u2019t get any more advanced than this. Much less commonly, where your vision is at risk, your ophthalmologist may recommend immunosuppressant treatment, usually steroids, to help reduce the inflammation. Orbital radiotherapy treatment may also be considered to treat the tissues around the eyeball and prevent optic nerve damage. The earlier these treatments can be given, the more they can help prevent the condition from progressing and protect your sight. In very severe cases, emergency orbital decompression surgery may be needed \u2013 this operation involves removing some of the bone and/or fat in your eye socket to provide more room for the swollen muscles, and to take the pressure off the optic nerve. All these treatments aim to avoid permanent damage to your optic nerve. Very few people have TED that progresses to a stage where these treatments are needed. During the active stage of TED, there are some things you can do that might help your symptoms. Puffiness around the eyelids tends to be worse in the mornings after lying flat. Sleeping propped up on extra pillows can help reduce the puffiness and congestion around your eyes. Symptoms of dry eye can be managed by using eye drops to moisten your eyes and they can usually be used frequently or as much as needed. Also trying to avoid, or protect your eyes in windy or dusty environments, can help, as these conditions might irritate your eyes; this can be done by wearing glasses or protective eyewear. You may also find that taking regular breaks when doing activities such as reading, watching television, and using computer screens can help keep your eyes feeling more comfortable. Even though treatment for your thyroid condition may not prevent or improve TED, it\u2019s important to keep your thyroid hormone levels at the correct levels. Make sure you have thyroid blood tests regularly and follow the advice given by your doctor about when and how to take your thyroid medication. Smoking increases your chances of developing TED and can also make it dramatically worse. Also, treatment is less effective in people with active TED who smoke. Because e-cigarettes also contain nicotine, these are also thought to increase your risk. Talk to your GP about getting help to quit. This is probably the most important thing you can do if you are a smoker. Some evidence suggests that taking selenium supplements (200 micrograms daily) may help people with mild thyroid eye disease. It\u2019s important to check with your GP whether taking supplements is safe for you, especially if you are taking other medications as well. If you find bright lights uncomfortable, reducing the amount of light entering your eyes by wearing sunglasses or tinted eye shields can help. In most people, the active inflamed stage of TED resolves (burns out) within about two years. In a few people, active TED can recur again after it has burnt out, although this becomes less likely the longer that the condition has been inactive. Treatment after TED has burnt out is aimed at dealing with any remaining double vision, providing better eyelid protection for your eyes and improving the appearance of your eyes. The swelling caused by TED can often improve once the active stage has passed, meaning there can be some improvement in the appearance of your eyes. However, you might be left with some changes caused by the swelling, such as eyelid retraction (where the upper eye lid is pulled upwards causing a staring appearance), exophthalmos (bulging of the eyes), large eyelid bags or double vision. This is because the tissues that have been inflamed are often less flexible once the active phase of the condition has passed, and they\u2019re not able to return to their original position. If this is the case, then you may wish to decide whether to have further surgery to help improve these changes. Sometimes the problems that are left may only be minor and you may feel treatment is not necessary, or that the risks of the surgery outweigh the problems that you have. If surgery is needed, it is usually done in a particular order, so orbital decompression surgery to reduce the amount of proptosis (if needed) is the first priority, then surgery for double vision, and lastly eyelid surgery (for lid retraction, for example). It\u2019s important to understand that often several surgeries will be required to manage the changes of TED and typically these operations are carried out over about 18 months to two years. It is well known that TED can affect your psychological and social well-being. You may feel anger, loss of self-esteem or confidence, or socially isolated, because of the change in the appearance of your eyes. Your mood can also be affected by medications you may be taking, such as steroids. TED can change your facial appearance and alter your expression which may affect the way people react to you which, understandably, can be difficult to cope with. Treatment, which may include surgery, can often improve this; and counselling, or contact with others who have TED, can help you find coping strategies. Some of the following organisations might be helpful: Thyroid Eye Disease Charitable Trust (TEDct) can help put you in touch with other people who have had similar experiences which is often helpful. The British Thyroid Foundation has a network of telephone support volunteers that can help. They also have closed Facebook groups for people with TED. You can email them at [email\u00a0protected] if you would like their support. The charity Changing Faces also offers a support service for anyone experiencing a condition or injury that affects their appearance. Our Counselling and Wellbeing team can offer telephone counselling to anyone affected by sight loss or an eye condition."

        "source": "Uveitis",
        "summary": "Uveitis is an eye condition where there is inflammation (swelling) inside your eye originating in a part of the eye called the uvea.",
        "content": "Uveitis affects people in different ways depending on which part of the uvea and eye is affected (front, middle or back). The symptoms of uveitis may include pain, sensitivity to bright lights and poor vision. However, some symptoms can be less obvious, making uveitis more difficult to diagnose initially. Some people may not notice any symptoms and so uveitis may not be detected for several weeks or months. Most cases of uveitis get better with treatment. Some types of uveitis are more difficult to treat because they are long-term and have sight-threatening inflammation which can also involve other tissues close by, causing more permanent changes to your sight. This page contains a summary of our information on uveitis. To read our full information, download our factsheet: Uveitis is described in different ways depending on which part of your uvea is affected: Anterior uveitis \u2013 inflammation of the iris or ciliary body. Intermediate uveitis \u2013 inflammation of the ciliary body and front part of the choroid, seen in the vitreous gel. Posterior uveitis \u2013 inflammation of the choroid and/or retina, retinal blood vessels or optic nerve head. Panuveitis \u2013 inflammation of all parts of the uvea. Uveitis may also be described depending on how long it lasts: Acute: when your uveitis starts suddenly but improves within three months. Recurrent: when the inflammation flares up and settles down over months and years. Anterior uveitis is usually recurrent with acute episodes. Chronic: when the inflammation is longer lasting and comes back within three months of stopping treatment. Intermediate and posterior types of uveitis are usually chronic. There are several known causes for uveitis but sometimes the cause is unknown (idiopathic). Possible causes include: autoimmune and inflammatory conditions infections injury. Anterior uveitis, sometimes called iritis, is when the iris or ciliary body at the front of your eye is inflamed. Anterior uveitis is the most common type of uveitis. The symptoms of anterior uveitis usually start over hours or days and often affect one eye at a time. It typically causes eye pain, eye redness and sensitivity to light (photophobia). Your eye can feel achy, and the eyeball may be tender. Your vision may be slightly blurred as well. For most people with anterior uveitis a course of eye drops is all the treatment needed to clear up the inflammation. Steroid eye drops Corticosteroid eye drops are used to reduce the inflammation at the front of the eye. Depending on the level of inflammation in your eye, the dose can range from using the eye drops every hour to using them just once a day. As the inflammation gets better, the dose will be reduced slowly by your ophthalmologist. It\u2019s important not to stop using your eye drops until your ophthalmologist tells you that it is safe to do so, even if your symptoms disappear, as stopping your treatment too soon can cause the inflammation to return. Cycloplegic or mydriatic eye drops Cycloplegic or mydriatic eye drops may be given for anterior uveitis in addition to steroid medication, but this is not always the case. Cycloplegic drops relieve your eye pain by paralysing the muscles of your iris and ciliary body as it is the movement of these inflamed muscles that cause the pain. An episode of acute anterior uveitis which has been treated promptly doesn\u2019t usually cause any long-term changes to your sight. This is because it responds quickly to treatment initially so only a short course of eye drops is needed, and most people recover within a few weeks. Some people will only ever have a single episode of anterior uveitis. However, it can recur or become chronic in which case it may cause more problems over time. Intermediate uveitis is when the area behind your ciliary body is affected, with most of the inflammation being seen in the vitreous gel, the jelly-like substance that fills your eye. Types of intermediate uveitis include vitritis \u2013 inflammation of the vitreous gel, and pars planitis \u2013 inflammation of the narrowed area (pars plana) between the iris and the choroid. Intermediate uveitis is most seen in young adults. Posterior uveitis affects the choroid (choroiditis) or retina (retinitis) or both. It can also affect the retinal blood vessels (vasculitis), or the optic nerve head, where the nerve fibres leave your eye to the brain. There are many types of posterior uveitis including birdshot chorioretinopathy and punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC). Posterior uveitis is the least common form of uveitis. Intermediate uveitis can cause dense floaters (black dots, shapes and wispy lines that move across your vision). It usually affects both of your eyes. Your vision may gradually feel blurrier and occasionally you may be sensitive to light. Some people with intermediate uveitis may also get anterior uveitis. Posterior uveitis causes blurry, distorted vision or patchiness or gaps in your vision. It can also cause problems with colour vision and/or seeing in the dark at night (nyctalopia). Intermediate or posterior uveitis don\u2019t usually cause any eye pain or redness. Treatment for uveitis can differ from person to person quite considerably and will also consider the cause of your uveitis. Steroid medication Apart from certain types of uveitis caused by infection, steroid medication (corticosteroids) is the mainstay of treating uveitis. Injections or implants Injections are used for intermediate or posterior uveitis to deliver the steroid to the parts of the eye that are inflamed. Injections can be given around the eye or into the eye. Steroids can be injected into the eye either as a liquid or as a small implant to treat non-infectious uveitis. Injections and implants are often used if only one eye requires treatment but can be given to both eyes. Oral medicine Oral (tablet) corticosteroids are another way of treating intermediate or posterior uveitis and are preferred in certain conditions or situations, such as if you have another inflammatory condition elsewhere in your body. Immunosuppressants Immunosuppressant medication may be recommended if uveitis doesn\u2019t respond to other treatments or to allow the dose of steroids to be reduced if they are causing you significant side effects. Treating infection If your uveitis is caused by an infection, the infection will need to be treated with antiviral or antibiotic tablets too. Surgery In rare cases, surgery may be needed to treat uveitis. However, this is usually only used if you have repeated or severe uveitis that affects the back of your eye. An operation called a vitrectomy to remove the vitreous (jelly that fills the eye) may be used. Anti-TNF drugs Treatment with anti-TNF medication may be given to people where treatments with corticosteroids or immunosuppressants haven\u2019t worked or if they are causing health problems, and the uveitis is causing worsening of vision. The way in which your sight may be affected in the long term by intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis or panuveitis may be due to the direct effects of the uveitis or its complications. Uveitis affecting the back of your eye tends to heal more slowly so treatment may continue for a longer period. How your sight will be affected in the short and long term varies so much among individuals. The length of time it takes for your eye(s) to respond to treatment and how long a flare-up lasts also varies from person to person. If you have chronic or recurrent uveitis you will usually be under the long-term care of an ophthalmologist and will have regular check-ups in the outpatient clinic. Uveitis needs to be treated promptly to try to reduce the risk of further problems that might affect your sight. Good control of inflammation can be achieved in most people, and this reduces the risk of developing complications. The treatments that are used for uveitis can have side effects (and may need monitoring) but controlling the uveitis properly with treatments will generally give a better outcome for your sight than under-treating and allowing the uveitis to continue. Some of the complications of uveitis include: raised eye pressure macula oedema cataracts floaters new blood vessel growth retinal detachment. It\u2019s completely natural to be upset when you have been diagnosed with uveitis and it\u2019s normal to find yourself worrying about the future and how you will manage with a change in your vision. We\u2019re here to support you every step of the way, and to answer any questions you may have \u2013 just get in touch with our Sight Loss Advice Service. In whatever way the uveitis has affected your sight, there are lots of things you can do to make the most of your vision. If uveitis has affected your sight, then ask your ophthalmologist, optometrist or GP about low vision aids, like a magnifier, and ask for a referral to your local low vision service. You should also ask whether you are eligible to register as sight impaired (partially sighted) or severely sight impaired (blind). Registration can act as your passport to expert help and sometimes to financial concessions. Even if you aren\u2019t registered a lot of this support is still available to you. Local social services should also be able to offer you information on staying safe in your home and getting out and about safely. They should also be able to offer you some practical mobility training to give you more confidence when you are out. Our Sight Loss Advice Service can also give you practical guidance on living with sight loss, and our Online Shop has products that can make everyday tasks easier. Uveitis Information Group have detailed information about uveitis on their website. Olivia\u2019s Vision can provide information, advice and support to anyone affected by uveitis, including uveitis in childhood. They can also help you connect with others in the same position. Birdshot Uveitis Society is a charity providing support and information for people with a type of uveitis called Birdshot chorioretinopathy."
